And that was exactly what I had been hinting at with my last sentence :-)

Original sin here is to have completely generic names for ata device 
objects (link-X? C'mon).

And trying to twiddle with the devnames will land you in the mess we are 
in now, _and_ you lose the link between device names in sysfs and what's 
printed in the logging message, making debugging ever so much fun.
(And I'm not even going into the _very_ slim distinction between port, 
link, and dev here ...)

I guess the only sane solution would be to have a clean break by 
introducing a new config variable like ATA_NEW_SYSFS_NAMING.
Then we could have 'sane' sysfs names like 'ata_port', 'ata_link', and 
'ata_dev', _and_ would avoid the 'sysfs is ABI and cannot be modified'
trap.

Plan would be to send a prep patch to partially revert patch 12, so as 
to re-introduce the original formatting, but keeping the new accessors.
And then have an additional patch to introduce the new-style sysfs 
layout, with the new config option. Which clearly would default to 'n' 
for now.

Hmm?

Cheers,

Hannes
