Nope. The correct way to do this would be to define PM operations for the ata
device. However, currently, the scsi_device (scsi_disk) parent is the ata_port,
so to make sure that the PM status of the parent propagates to the child
correctly, we would need to have the scsi_device parent set to the ata_device.
As I said, correcting this is not simple and will involve a significant amount
of changes.

Please send the exact messages you see in dmesg.
