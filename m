The current code for port system resume looks like this:

static int ata_port_pm_resume(struct device *dev)
{
	if (!pm_runtime_suspended(dev))
		ata_port_resume(to_ata_port(dev), PMSG_RESUME, true);
        return 0;
}

So if the port was runtime suspended before the system was suspended, it will
not be resumed and there will be no device revalidation on system resume.
But as we know, runtime suspending a port does not work...

Yes. Many embedded systems and people using old PCs still use that.
And that is not the only case. Port multiplier is the other major one since
multiple drives share the same link. In both cases, the drive "think" it is
talking to its own port, but the port is used to manage several devices. One
consequence of this is that the link speed for the port MUST be limited to the
lowest link speed of all devices. And to discover that, one has to probe all 15
ports of the PMP to discover the devices attached... Hence the fact that
bypassing revalidation being a really bad idea.

EH == error handler. So normally EH triggers only when there are errors. The
other case EH is used is for port scan, device revalidation, etc. Any internal
task that libata needs to do. The reason for using EH for these cases is that
libata internally issued commands are non-NCQ commands, which cannot be mixed
with the NCQ commands that result from the uppoer layers requests (block layer
and scsi disk). Using EH allows stopping these commands for EH to operate
exclusively on the device (or port). That is why suspend/resume use EH.

Patching udisk and smartd would be a lot more sensible. An application using
passthrough to talk to a drive without first checking if the drive is actually
active is not a sensible thing to do. Especially considering that runtime
autosuspend is a user initiated setup, systemd/udisk/smartd should respect that
setup and not attempt to poke at a disk that is sleeping.
