It *IS* something we get on suspend/resume.  During suspend the drive
loses power, and on resume, it regains power.  As far as the drive is
concerned, the computer was shutdown and booted back up, so it powers up
in standby.

Interesting.  I was under the impression that most disks have to read
their sererial number and possibly other information from the media in
order to report that in IDENTIFY, and therefore, they would have to
finish spinning up before they could return complete information.

That looks very good.  I think I will try to adapt my old patch to allow
the eh to return -EAGAIN and leave the drive in standby rather than
force it to wake up with the VERIFY in the system resume path.  The eh
can be retried later when the drive is actually accessed and that time
it can force it to spin up.
