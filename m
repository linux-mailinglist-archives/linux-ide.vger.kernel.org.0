The patch as fixed by Damien looks reasonable, although I don't think
it actually fixes anything ... if we get an ENOMEM there the system
won't boot because you likely can't contact your root drive, so an oops
would make the point more vividly.

However, the original patch:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220124164525.53068-1-zhou1615@umn.edu/

does look suspiciously like a fishing attempt to see if we'd notice the
logic inversion in the supposed null check.
