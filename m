If your port is external or hot plug capable, then your platform firmware/BIOS
should set either the "PORT_CMD_ESP and HOST_CAP_SXS" bits or the
"PORT_CMD_HPCP" bit.

See:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/ata?id=45b96d65ec68f625ad26ee16d2f556e29f715005

Is there any option in your BIOS to mark the port as external or hot plug
capable?


If not, then your platform firmware is broken and needs to be quirked.

Please provde the output from
# dmidecode
so that we can apply a quirk for your broken platform.

In older kernels, regardless if your AHCI controller reported support for
low-power modes or not, you also needed an explicit entry in ahci_pci_tbl for
it to be enabled.

Thus, even if you built with CONFIG_SATA_MOBILE_LPM_POLICY=3, and LPM was
being reported as supported by your AHCI controller, LPM was most likely not
enabled for your AHCI controller with older kernels.

In newer kernels, if CONFIG_SATA_MOBILE_LPM_POLICY=3, and the AHCI controller
reports that it supports LPM, we will enable it.
(We will not enable LPM if the port is external or hot plug capable, as that
breaks hot plug, as you found out.)

According to the AHCI specification, a port that is external or hot plug
capable should set the "PORT_CMD_ESP and HOST_CAP_SXS" bits or the
"PORT_CMD_HPCP" bit.

If your platform fails to follow the AHCI specification, then it will need to
be quirked.


Kind regards,
Niklas
