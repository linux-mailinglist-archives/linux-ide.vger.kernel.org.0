Disabling NCQ caused the disk to NOT count a smart Command_Timeout, it did not stop the actual pauses/resets.

This is happening for a while now, using:
	6.17.6-200.fc42.x86_64
	6.17.7-200.fc42.x86_64
Before the start it was running without a problem:
	6.16.3 - 6.16.12	since Aug 23
	6.17.4-200.fc42.x86_64	since Oct 24 20:48:40	
First timeout/reset a day later	at    Oct 25 20:09:27

I did set the timeout as high at 240s and found that if a pause is longer than 30s then it will always continue and timeout.
I can set it higher if there is a possibility that it WILL complete the write. Is it worth it? How long?

The system runs off nvme and includes a 7 disk raid6.

Maybe relevant:
	for a while (recently) following a reset this disk would downshift (6.0->3.0->1.5Gbps).
	For a period it would actually boot up at 3.0Gbps.
	It is back to 6.0Gbps for about 2 weeks (and many resets).

I still suspect the disk itself it at fault (I have a replacement synced and ready).

Yes, this is the size of almost all commands. With NCQ enabled the sizes are very variable and often less that 1 MiB.

Regardless, I am not set up to build a kernel (I used to), and being my main server I hesitate to fiddle with it.
I will keep this disk active and observe the situation.
