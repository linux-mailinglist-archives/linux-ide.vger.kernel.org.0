How? Where are boot logs with working/not working conditions?

And see official documentation on ASMedia site
https://www.asmedia.com.tw/product/A58yQC9Sp5qg6TrF/58dYQ8bxZ4UR9wG5

[....]
SATA interface

AHCI SPEC Rev. 1.4
Four SATA Gen3 (6GBps) ports
Support NCQ
Support SATA LED
Supported port multiplier command based switching
[....]

Four ports. Nothing more, nothing less.

Yes, if it connects each of its ports to four or five JMB575 into PMP
mode - it's able to provide 16/20 SATA ports. And this patch changed
nothing there.
