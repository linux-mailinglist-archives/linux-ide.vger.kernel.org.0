Subject: [PATCH 0/1] Only activate drive once during system resume

I have been wondering why I kept seeing drives activated twice
during system resume since this got added.  It seems that the EH
process can run up to 5 times as long as there is still pending
EH.  I am not sure why, but it look like my Intel AHCI controller
issues an error interrupt during the first round of EH, even
though there does not appear to be any error.  This causes
the EH_PENDING flag to be set again, and so a second round of
EH happens, which then tries to activate the disk a second time.

I propose the following patch to only set the ACTIVE flag once.
