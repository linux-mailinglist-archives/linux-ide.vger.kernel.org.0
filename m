That is also possible. But existence of a38x sata specific errata smells.

> The comment said: "sata_down_spd_limit should return if driver has not recorded sstatus speed". This probably means that ahci-mvebu does not record the expected "sstatus speed". I don't know what that is, but Damien probably does.

Lets wait for Damien.

Also note that in kernel ahci_mvebu.c driver code is custom function
ahci_mvebu_stop_engine where is description of another Errata Ref#226 -
SATA Disk HOT swap issue when connected through Port Multiplier in
FIS-based Switching mode.

This errata is documented _only_ for A3720 (not A38x/A39x) but is
installed for all mvebu platforms. So I'm not sure if this is not
another kernel bug and code should be adjusted to _not_ install
ahci_mvebu_stop_engine for a38x/a39x.

Hehe... those documents lot of time contains incomplete or ambiguous
statements and also professionals cannot understand them...

As I wrote in previous email, errata Ref #: FE-8889968 just says:
Due to the wrong Busy status returned, the GEN 1.0 Port Multiplier
cannot establish a link with the SATA 3.0 interface. As a workaround
connect GEN 1.0 Port Multiplier to a SATA 2.0 interface.

And I'm not SATA expert too. Lets wait for Damien.
