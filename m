Correct, if it succeeds, no need to do it again. The problem with clearing the
flag though is that ATA_EH_SET_ACTIVE is for the device and that is set only if
ATA_PFLAG_RESUMING is set, but that one is for the port. So if resume for the
device succeeds, you can clear the ATA_PFLAG_RESUMING flag *only* if there is
only a single link/device for that port. If not, other devices on the port may
need a retry so we cannot clear ATA_PFLAG_RESUMING.

Ah, now I think I understand: is it your patch that prevents resuming a drive if
it has PUIS on ? If yes, then sure, the verify command to spin-up the drive will
indeed fail immediately if the drive is in standby from PUIS, since getting out
of standby state driven by PUIS requires a set features spinup. So... with your
patch, things will not work.

If PUIS is not enabled, the only thing wasted is a check power mode command. If
the drive confirms that it is active, verify command is not issued.

With PUIS enabled though, if you leave the drive in standby mode, when/how do
you actually wake it up ?

Scratching my head about this, I think that doing this cleanly should be
possible if:
1) The dive gives complete identify data when that command is issued with the
drive in standby state driven by PUIS.
2) The call to ata_dev_configure() executed by ata EH started from system resume
does not spinup the device if requested not to (libata module & sysfs parameter
can do that). But I think this requires that the drive be instead put into a
state equivalent to *runtime* suspend, that is, with the scsi disk associated
with the device must also be in runtime suspend state.

With that, it would only be a matter of adding a device flag to remember that
the drive is in "PUIS stnadby" instead of regular standby, and then have
ata_dev_power_set_active() use a set feature spinup command instead of a verify.
Drive spinup will then be cleanly driven by accesses to the scsi disk, similarly
to a regular runtime suspend.

With such changes, everything would be cleaner and safer and all work as
expected. The exception will be drives that do not give complete identify data
when PUIS is on. For these, it is too risky to not wake them up to get the full
information first.

Do you want to try to tackle this ? If you do not feel like it, I can give it a
try too.
