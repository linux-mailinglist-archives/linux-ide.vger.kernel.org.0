Polling and a warning, when polling time exceeds like 10 ms, so users 
can contact the hardware vendor, would indeed be the most flexible solution.

Robin, do you remember, why these patches were not applied? Just lack of 
time and review, or where there issues?

Indeed, I did not think of that.

Awesome.

Thank you for cooking this up. I tested this on the ASUS F2A85-M PRO 
(AMD, 1022:0x7801), MSI B350M MORTAR (AMD, 1022:0x7901), and IBM S822LC 
(Marvell, 1b4b:9235) with no issues and the expected decrease in boot time.
