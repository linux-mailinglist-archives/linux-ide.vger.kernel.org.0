Did you see my analysis of this problem here:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-ide/066b051d-f092-4ba2-9a26-1c73f3df4252@redhat.com/

It seems that the ASM1166/ASM1064 sata controllers transparently handle
attached PMP-s of up to 4 ports per PMP which is why the 4 port ASM1064
advertises 16 (4x4) extra "virtual" ports and the 6 port advertises
24 (6x4) extra "virtual" ports.

When a PMP is attached then this is handled inside the controller and
the attached disks show up on the extra port numbers 8-23 / 8 - 31
(and nothing shows on the actual port numbers 0-3 / 0-5).

So the "fix" to get the boards with PMP to work again is to drop
the quirk restricting the number of ports to the number of physical
ports, so that Linux probes the virtual-ports again and then everything
works again as before, with the downside of probing the virtual ports
slowing down the boot.

Ah, ok so I think you did see my reply? Checking if we can ignore
the builtin PMP support and uses Linux PMP support instead is
indeed an option.

I think we should still merge the revert / dropping of the quirk
while we figure this out though, because not finding people's disks
anymore is a clear regression.

Hans
