Indeed, there seem to be quite a few threads about this or very similar issues.
Had no time for proper research but there seemed to be some solutions as well
so hopefully you'll find a way to solve this eventually. If you're stuck, feel
free to email me & describe what you have tried so far. I'm no expert but I
wouldn't mind looking into this.

However, as for now, let's concentrate on the problem at hand.

Don't get me wrong. I had no intention of belittling the problem. I asked as
you had included multiple drives, which initially confused me a bit. As for the
problem as such, it is certainly worth at least looking into. While a drive can
take a considerable number of such brutal shutdowns, the problem should indeed
be dealt with in the long run.

Let's assume for now that it affects only external / USB drives. As I
understand, this is what your SMART data & observations seem to support as
well.

I did some testing (using linux 5.4.12) with my own external drive and had
rather intriguing results. In short, the problem seems to exist on shutdown
(cannot read SMART to confirm but that's what my ears tell me) but not when the
system is halted (shutdown -H). Halting results in the drive spinning down as
it should. In my case internal drives are fine either way as expected, no
shutdown issues whatsoever.


This may indeed mean that power is cut too early as you suggested but I dare
not speculate here at the moment. 

Perhaps I can test with some other external drives in the case of which SMART
data is available (easy to access). Just to check once more that the problem is
indeed there.

I'll contact someone more knowledgeable. Let's see what they have to say.
