There is a lot of info in Marvell Armada 38x Functional Specifications ma=
nual, but I don't
understand it. "FIS" is mentioned.
See https://ulli-kroll.de/Downloads/NAS326/A38x-Functional-Spec-PU0A.pdf =
, page 241.

From my kernel log:
ahci-mvebu f10a8000.sata: flags: 64bit ncq sntf led only pmp fbs pio slum=
 part sxs
From https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/SATA_hardware_features
pmp means "port multiplier"
fbs means "FIS based switching"

Areca didn't write information so detailed in the manual, but it does say=
 it supports NCQ,
so according to Wikipedia article you indicated, it probably isn't comman=
d-based switching.
Is there any way to get this info from the working router (sata-mv)? Or i=
f I connect it to a desktop PC?
