Hi, not originally in the thread, but I've run into hardware where the
delay was bumpy before, when I did early porting around SATA PMP code
(https://dev.gentoo.org/~robbat2/patches/libata-development/ if you want
to see really old patches from 2006)

This series esp of a code approach that didn't get merged might be
interesting, that implements hotplug by polling:

I think this is a key thing here; and I like that your patch moves to a
flag.

I agree that removing it by default is right, but I'd like to make one
additional request here:
Please add a libata.force= flag that lets users enable/disable the delay
per adapter/link.

I think this would be valuable to rule out issues where the debounce
delay is needed on the drive side more than the controller side, esp. in
cases of poorly implemented port multipliers as Tejun & I found back in
2006.

Maybe libata.force=X.Y:no_debounce_delay & libata.force=X.Y:force_debounce_delay

The ata_parse_force_one function as it stands can't handle a parameter
to the value, so you cannot get libata.force=X.Y:debounce_delay=N
without also improving ata_parse_force_one.

Nice find!

That gets likely single-disk worst/best case, but I'm still worried
about port multipliers (sadly I don't have the worst-implemented ones
anymore, I sold them to some Windows users)
