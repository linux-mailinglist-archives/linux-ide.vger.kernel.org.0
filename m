SDB SMART log

Greetings,

I've got an external Toshiba HDD in good conditions (USB 3.0 cable on USB 2.0
port) that I use to store backups and my work in.
Every time the system shuts down (either by terminal command or regular OS UI),
the system does not wait for the hdd to park/spin down (as seen by the systemd
logs), and instead, cuts the power off too early, making the disc make an acute
screeching sound as if by hard power cutoff.

I believe the same thing is happening to my internal hdd (second one on linux,
previous one was old and had the same problem), but I can't be sure as the
sound isn't too clear.

I have reported this bug to the distribution's bug tracker (Lubuntu) and
systemd, but I was requested to come here instead, as the problem must be down
to the kernel.

I have tested this on Linux Mint and the same has happened. As additional
information, both on Windows 10 and FreeBSD, this problem did not occur.

I'll attach smartctl logs for both HDDs. The logs say old_age and pre_fail, but
this is most likely not true, as I have bought them recently and smartctl
doesn't seem to be that smart at times.

I await your reply,
Hélder
