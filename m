That could be one way, but instead I propose to have only second part
(so enum + generic-ahci) for all compatibles mentioned in
ahci_platform.c, which do not customize the driver behavior for these
compatibles..

There is no property named "interrupt" or "phy". There is only
"interrupts", "phys", "gpios", "clocks" etc. regardless whether there is
one or multiple items. This is not specific to bindings, but all DTS
have this.

But the sources of the driver and DTS are available, why not using them?

Yes. See example schema.

This part I do not understand.

I believe that information - how many resets - is in general findable
via driver sources. In all bindings conversions, if we do not have such
information, we need to try to look it up.

Why try-and-error? "git grep" works here...

True, but having stricter limit, even if not fully correct, is better
than having too loose limit. Stricter can be always loosened. Loose
requirement cannot be made stricter.
