   OK. But I think it's all a matter of a separate patch. I don't want to touch
the LBA branches in this same patch...

   I don't think this is a good idea. Looking at the produced x86 32-bit code,
gcc produces an extra (3rd) multiplication instruction for no value.

> will avoid overflows too, which was possible before,

   No, it wasn't possible. Any possible CHS capacity always fits into 32 bits --
max # of sectors per track is 255, max # of heads is only 16.
   What actually seems to make sense is changing the order of multiplications
to first multiply # of sectors by # of heads and than multiply that by # of
cylinders...

   Because there's not problem. :-)
   The current CHS capacity is stored in the words 57-58 (so 32-bit) and we
could read it from there instead of the multiplications... BUT I do remember
the disks (IIRC Fujitsu... but I'm not sure now -- that was back in 90s!)
that had totally wrong value in these words... so the code we have now is
a good thing! :-)

   Indeed, the CHS days are long gone... :-)
