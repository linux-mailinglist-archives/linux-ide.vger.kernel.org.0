devno used in ata_find_dev() is scsidev->id, which is always 0 for a non-pmp
SATA drive (and can be 1 for an IDE slave drive). But with libsas, that number
is 0, 1, 2, 3... numbering the devices found on the HBA port. Hence
ata_find_dev() return NULL always because the ata_link_max_devices() is always 1
for any libsas ata device as they all have their own ata_port & ata_link.

Yes. So the sdev->id goes beyond 0 and cannot be used as the devno for the
devices as they each have their own port & link.

Indeed. That would be nicer. And ata_link_max_devices() could use that as well.

I am not super happy about the wording of the comment. Suggestions welcome :)
I will at least reword to mention the counting of devices per shost.

> I did send another suggestion, so I'll leave it to you.

I kind of like the loop as it does not need a devno but it also implies that we
do have a scsi dev already while ata_find_dev() currently does not assume that.
Given that this function is also used in ata_scsi_user_scan() where we do not
have a sdev, it would not work for all cases.

Yes. I will clean that up after sending this fix for this cycle. The cleanup
will be for 6.5.
