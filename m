Hi,

sorry for the "small" delay... I got distracted and only now revisited
this topic as I wanted to use discard to improve backup space
efficiency and pondered on using devices_handle_discard_safely of the
raid456 module (I run ext4 on lvm on luks on raid5 on 3 ssds) since
otherwise I cannot trim at all.

My inquiry deals with two points:
 - Discussing the addition of ATA_HORKAGE_ZERO_AFTER_TRIM for Crucial
   CT500MX500 (or CT*MX500 to include the 250 GB, 1 TB and 2 TB models)
 - Determining why the Samsung SSD 860 EVO is not recognized to zero
   after trim

I can look for some smartctl logs of similar models but it is obviously
the case for mine.

Since Crucial has stopped producing new models I think it makes sense
to eventually conclude this topic and make some (final?) changes if
need be. Apparently the queued trim issues are not fully figured out
yet (saw commits to Linus' tree a short while ago on that) - so maybe
final-ish changes ;)

Sure, but since the whitelist was filled with devices that have been
tested/validated empirically, I wonder how thorough this needs to be
to add a drive with good confidence. After all, the vendor wildcard
for Crucial SSDs[1] has been quite broad and only restricted later
with blacklist entries (only due to NCQ trim and LPM problems AFAICT)...
So while queued trim is not blacklisted on my device the safe zeroing
assumption is not whitelisted for no other reason than the model
string missing "Crucial " at the beginning.

But that's only to distinguish ATA_HORKAGE_NO_NCQ_TRIM I guess? While
this seems to be the major culprit of trim related issues I don't care
about that (yet).

Yes, I could have checked strace :)

> You get "0" for the discard granularity on the Samsung?

Not for the granularity - that's fine I presume - but for the zeroing
capability. This is still the case (with Linux 5.10). I would have
expected that to be non-zero for devices with
ATA_HORKAGE_ZERO_AFTER_TRIM.

# lsblk -o PATH,MODEL,DISC-ALN,DISC-GRAN,DISC-MAX,DISC-ZERO -d
PATH     MODEL                           DISC-ALN DISC-GRAN DISC-MAX DISC-ZERO
/dev/sda CT500MX500SSD4                         0        4K       2G         0
/dev/sdb CT500MX500SSD4                         0        4K       2G         0
/dev/sdc Samsung_SSD_860_EVO_mSATA_500GB        0      512B       2G         0

Just to make sure lsblk is not lying:
# cat /sys/block/sdc/queue/discard_zeroes_data 
0

I don't understand why that's the case.
