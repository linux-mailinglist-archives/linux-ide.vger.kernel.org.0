Oh, okay.  I'm pretty sure that blkid checks regions near the end of a
device (for example, GPT has what looks like a backup of the "EFI
PART" boot record near the end of the device).  Therefore, it may be
worthwhile to double-check the size of the partition, in case they're
not 4 GB, for some strange reason.

I don't know about that, but keep in mind that other programs can use
libblkid to check devices for metadata, so implementing the udev rule
may not be enough.

Here's an excerpt of the dmesg lines from the first error:

Why is there an "Illegal Request - Unaligned write command" sense
error from sd, right after the failed ata command "READ FPDMA QUEUED"?
 Is this an expected failure mode for a read to a locked range?  (I'm
not familiar with TCG Opal drives, so unfortunately I don't have
enough context.)


Thanks,

Bryan
