   No, just changing *int* to 'bool' wasn't the purpose of this patch --
I would not have called it a fix if it was so.

   In general case, it is an issue -- as it involves a sign extension (and
thus a needless extra instruction on an x86_64 kernel)! However, with the
possible *int* values just being 0 and 1, it's not much of issue indeed
(except an extra instruction just being there)...  In reality , that extra
instruction is not there, probably due to ata_ioc32() being inlined...

   I don't really know -- all I have is the online report generated for the
whole 5.10 kernel. I still can't re-run SVACE but maybe that will change soon...

   A cast from 'bool' should be OK... :-)
