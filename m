Unless you can recreate this issue with the latest kernel (6.7-rc8, soon to be
6.7.0), check if the issue is still there or not, and bisect if it not, there is
not much we can do for such an old kernel. We are certainly not going to debug
it directly. But if you can bisect to a fix patch, we can have that patch
backported to LTS. But even then 4.18 is *not* an LTS kernel, so you will need
to work with your distribution vendor to get that fixed in their distribution
kernel.

Looking at the error message, I would suggest you try disabling NCQ (echo 1 >
/sys/block/sdX/device/queue_depth).
