I have seen both smartd and udisks2 do this when they attempt to check
the SMART status of the drive.  They already issue a CHECK POWER MODE
command first and skip the SMART read if the drive is in standby, but
even this causes a drive that is in SLEEP mode to be woken up.

Also filesystems often issue FLUSH CACHE even though they have not
written anything to the disk, and there is nothing in the cache.  Drives
in standby just treat this as a NOOP, but a drive in SLEEP can not.

Having a sysfs attribute that smartd/udisks2 could check before issuing
CHECK POWER MODE would help that case, but not the FLUSH CACHE case.

It already does that.  When the SLEEP command is issued, libata sets
ATA_DFLAG_SLEEPING.

I realized that one of the patches was redundant anyhow, and just
finished writing up a good cover letter for the remaining 3.  Incoming.
