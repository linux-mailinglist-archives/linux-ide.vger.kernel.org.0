OK. I am a bit fuzzy on what ACPI modes do :)

The incomplete IDENTIFY with PUIS is likely very common with old drives. Newer
ones may not rely on the media for metadata, especially enterprise drives.

The timeouts for identify when scanning the device are defined by
ata_eh_identify_timeouts in libata-eh.c. So 5s, 10s and 30s defined in 3
retries. But on boot, without PUIS, the drive is already (mostly) spun up
generally when the scan code is executed. So even the short-ish first timeout of
5s is enough. But for resume, the time between restoring power and executing
IDENTIFY is much shorter, so the first 5s timeout is a little too short.
IDENTIFY will be OK with the second 10s timeout for most drives, but I do have
some that are very slow and endup needing the third 30s timeout.

To avoid that, I think we need to use the longer ata_eh_reset_timeouts or define
a set of resume timeouts (e.g. a ata_eh_resume_timeouts array).

The problem here is the potentially incomplete IDENTIFY on resume. We need the
full IDENTIFY to ensure that nothing changed with the drive. So for a drive that
reports an incomplete IDENTIFY with PUIS, we need to spin up that drive on
resume, even if it was runtime suspended before the system suspend.

Yes, that would be nice to have such feature, but I do not see how to reliably
implement that.

Sure, but I think we can skip the spinup only and only if the drive has PUIS
enabled and reported a complete IDENTIFY: in this case, we can skip the SET
FEATURES command that spins up the drive to leave the drive spun down. Some more
code will be needed though so that we track that the drive is spun sdown because
of PUIS and not because of STANDBY IMMEDIATE, so that ata_dev_power_set_active()
issues a SET FEATURES to spinup the drive instead of the regular VERIFY command.

If the drive has PUIS and reported an incomplete IDENTIFY, we need to spin it up
to finish revalidation normally. And for drives that do not have PUIS or have
PUIS disabled, the drive will spin up on system resume, always. For these, we
could call ata_dev_power_set_standby() at the end of revalidation to be
consistent with the runtime suspend state (if the drive was runtime suspended
before the system suspend.

Note: I am still not able to see runtime suspend automatically suspend the ata
port if I enable a scsi disk autosuspend_delay_ms. That does not happen for me.
In fact, I cannot even read a ata port autosuspend delay:

cat /sys/class/ata_port/ata2/power/autosuspend_delay_ms
cat: /sys/class/ata_port/ata2/power/autosuspend_delay_ms: Input/output error

But I have:

cat /sys/class/ata_port/ata2/power/control
auto

So this is all weird. There is a bug somewhere. I need to dig into that.
