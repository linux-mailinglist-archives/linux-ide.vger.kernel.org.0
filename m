I completely agree that this is very strange, but on the NAS440 those few lines make a difference.

There was doubt whether the PCI-MVEBU driver was working correctly, which is why I
created the bug https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216094 some time ago.

Unfortunately, no significant progress could be made there. I'm CC-ing 
Bjorn Helgaas and Krzysztof WilczyÅ„ski with the kind wish to draw attention to this issue.

I added the full boot log as attachment to the bug report above:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=306531&action=edit

Please do not get confused by the number of hard disks: The relevant HDD
is the Gen2 WDC WD5000AADS in slot 1, all other disks are only for double-checking
things (Gen1 HDD for cross-testing in slot 2, slot 3+4 are always working
with sata_mv driver).

Sections in the log:

1. After system boot and "modprobe pci-mvebu" the AHCI driver fails to
detect the Gen2 HDD in slot 1 (id ata3)

2. After "rmmod && insmod"-ing libahci.ko with (only) sata_lpm_ignore_phy_events()
commented out, the Gen2 HDD is detected (id ata6 with 3Gbps).

3. Some interrupt und lspci info.

4. Temporary ata6 connection problem ("qc timeout") but survives, still able to
mount a vfat partition. No more problems after this (at least for ~24 hours).

Please let me know if I can help with other things.

Hajo
