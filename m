But who is issuing these commands ? If it is systemd/udev, then *that* need to
be patched to avoid it issuing these commands when the drive is sleeping.
Otherwise, there is no end to this. Next time systemd/udev is modified and start
issuing another command, we'll need to ignore that one as well. This is a
dangerous path that I am not willing to accept.

That would mean having a sysfs attribute indicating that the device is sleeping
though. So the sleep case needs more work.

As long as you can only set sleep mode with hdparm, there is not much we can do.
hdparm uses passthrough commands, and so handling whatever that tool does in the
kernel becomes a nightmare as libata would need to parse the issued commands and
handle their result. Only a few cases are done now. Extending that would be
difficult and fragile.

Rather, I would recommend improving the runtime pm code to allow for "going to
sleep" instead of "going to standby". A sysfs attribute switch can be used for
that, with the default being standby like now.

And yes, please split the series ! One for what you want to do for puis and
another for improved sleep handling. Everything together is simply too confusing.
