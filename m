Yes I believe that this is what is happening, the physical-ports 0-3
are obviously connected to the JMB575 Port Multipliers, but I believe
the "emulated" ports seen by the OS are mapped like this:

0-3  Only show as connected to the OS is connected directly to a disk
     without a PMP
4-19 Only show as connected to the OS when PMPs are used and the mapped
     port on the PMP has a disk connected

Because of this emulation it does make sense that we cannot reach
the PMPs since ports 0-3 are faked as disconnected when the controller
has detected a PMP. And ports 4-19 map to the ports on the "other side"
of the PMP. So there is no way for the kernel to talk to the upstream
port of the PMP I guess.

Ack. I think we should just go back to also probing the emulated
extra ports so as to not regress systems where this was all working
before and then add a module option to allow skipping the emulated
ports to speed-up probing.

Note in other part of the thread it was suggested to make this
speed-up probing option enabled by default. I'm strongly against
enabling this by default. A slow boot is much less of a problem
then systems all of a sudden no longer finding disks.

If we can get some insights on how to deal with this from ASMedia
and maybe come up with a better fix that would be great.

So lets hold of on adding the module option.

But can we please drop the problematic quirk to lower the number
of ports for now, to avoid more people getting bitten by this
regression ?

Regards,

Hans
