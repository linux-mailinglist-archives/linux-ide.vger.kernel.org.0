Well, we could in theory add a trex socket driver to get PCMCIA support
for the PowerBook 190 hardware. There was a driver for that in ppc for
the PowerBook 5300 which uses the same chipset. I believe the PCMCIA
drivers use these same macros in spite of not being considered ISA.
I don't see anything in drivers/pcmcia that is obviously an m68k
system even though I'm pretty sure I remember discussions of supporting
such hardware in the past.

Is PCMCIA support something we should also consider in all of this?
