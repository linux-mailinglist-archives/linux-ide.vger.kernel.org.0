From what AMD people told us, this controller is not the same as the ancient
ATI based AHCI controller that had a bunch of problems with LPM.

Also, LPM works on some ports, but not others. That suggests that the AHCI
controller actually supports LPM and that this is a BIOS / integration issue.

The table in ahci_broken_lpm() previously included BIOS versions that were
good. (There has been a new version released that has fixed the LPM problem
that existed in older BIOSes.)


I recently added the "ASUSPRO D840MB_M840SA", which does not have any good
version.

I was thinking that they probably won't release any new BIOS versions for
"ASUSPRO D840MB_M840SA" and your motherboard, so most likely we will never
need to bump these. But perhaps that is a silly assumption.

Perhaps a better solution would have been to have two tables?

One table that looks like before. (Anything older than the "good" version
gets LPM disabled.) And then a new table for boards that we quirk
unconditionally (because there is no new version that fixes the LPM problems).

Because like you say, perhaps the manufacturer will release a new BIOS with
simply a small hotfix, and will thus have a newer build date, but will still
have broken LPM.

Perhaps I should throw out some of the commits from for-6.16-fixes, and
implement it using two tables instead.

(Commit 6f29d393061c ("ata: ahci: Use correct BIOS build date for ThinkPad
W541 quirk") can still be kept.)

I don't think this drive will get any new FW.


Kind regards,
