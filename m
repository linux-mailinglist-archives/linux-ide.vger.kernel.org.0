Yes. The risk though is that if the fallout are not minimal and we get too
many bug reports, we'll likely have to revert. So this needs to be
attempted early at the beginning of a cycle to get plenty of testing.

If we add a proper "nofua" horkage flag to blacklist buggy drives, we need
to move the fua parameter to be an argument of the force parameter so that
disabling fua can be done per drive (port) or for all drives, similarly to
other tweak (noncq, nodmalog, etc)
