Hello Phillip,

Thank you for your series!


Some small advice:

1) Your patches are missing a Signed-off-by tag.
Without this, we can't accept your changes, see:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#sign-your-work-the-developer-s-certificate-of-origin


2) The cover letter should explain and summarize the
overall problem that the patch series addresses.

It is also nice with a small change log, so we know
what changed between V1 and V2.


3) The commit messages should explain the specific
problem that the commit fixes in greater detail, see:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes

After the problem is established, describe what you
are actually doing about it in technical detail.


""I have been wondering why I kept seeing drives activated
twice during system resume since this got added.""

If possible, please reference a specific SHA1, otherwise we
might not know what "this got added" actually refers to.


4) Please use git format-patch and git send-email.

Looking at
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-ide/
as well as my local inbox,
the threading seems very wrong.

There is a [PATCH 0/1], and then a patch "[PATCH 0/1 v2]"
that replies to the [PATCH 0/1].

Additionally, there is also a [PATCH 1/4] that also replies
to the [PATCH 0/1].

It is just impossible to follow.

For more info, see:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#explicit-in-reply-to-headers


If you simply use:
$ git format-patch -v 1 -o my-series-v1 v6.7..
$ git send-email my-series-v1/*.patch

for v1 of your series. And then:

$ git format-patch -v 2 -o my-series-v2 v6.7..
$ git send-email my-series-v2/*.patch

for v2 of your series, there will be no explicit
In-Reply-To headers that messes up the threading.


Kind regards,
Niklas
