Thanks for that. Niklas and I will look at this (I thought we already had fixed
that issue...). However, this week may be difficult as Niklas and I are
attending a conference and we may not have time to do much. But this will be our
highest priority next week.

Yes, please check that.

I think that the issue is that this HDD power-off is done way too early as the
mem image saving generates IOs which wake up the drive again. The 1s it takes
for this is because the HDD started spinning down and needs to be spun up again.

This is likely because the mem image must be prepared with the devices already
suspended so that when restoring the image, the restarts sees the devices
suspended (as they should be). For this case, libata (or scsi SD PM code, not
sure which one) should suspend the device logically but not spin down the
physical HDD...

... and the power off of the HDD should happen here.

That is a weird one, but again I think due to the IO activity that loading the
mem image generates. Similarly, I think this is a mishandling of the device
logical state vs physical power state...

It would really be helpful if you could bisect this !

This is relevant. This is not really an error but rather a statement that your
device does not support sleep. This could be the reason for the behavior. (hence
my request that if you could test with a different device, it would be help).

Yeah... I see these all the time on different machines. That comes from the BIOS
not being great :) Not sure if that one relates to SATA though ?

Given that you had 6.4.12 working OK, it is likely some commit that introduced a
regression. If you can git bisect it, we will have a better idea how to remove
the regression.

Best regards.
