That is because the PM operations are defined for the *port*, not the *device*
(struct ata_device). With the missing PM ops for the device, PM core simply
sets the device as active.

Also, the port PM runtime resume operation is synchronous with EH, that is, it
waits for EH to complete before returning. This wait is done with the device
lock held, so calling any PM function that takes the device lock within EH
context can deadlock... That is very likely what you are seeing.
