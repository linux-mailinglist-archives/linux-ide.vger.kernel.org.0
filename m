Yes, the above code is not rigorous, existing methods provided by kernel as you
said should be used in this case.

In order to use CAP flags to validate user policy, I review the latest kernel
LPM policies, here is my understanding:
ATA_LPM_UNKNOWN: default policy, no LPM
ATA_LPM_MAX_POWER: disable LPM (hipm & dipm)
ATA_LPM_MED_POWER: enable hipm partial
ATA_LPM_MED_POWER_WITH_DIPM: enable hipm partial &dipm partial &slumber
ATA_LPM_MIN_POWER_WITH_PARTIAL: enable hipm partial &dipm partial&slumber&devslp
ATA_LPM_MIN_POWER: enable hipm slumber &dipm partial &slumber &devslp
hipm: adpter initiated power mode transitions;
dipm:*device* initiated power mode transitions;

 From my comprehension, user policy in [ATA_LPM_MED_POWER, ATA_LPM_MIN_POWER]
need to be validated on adapter's capabilities (partial(y/n), slumber(y/n),
devslp(y/n)), so, there exits the following cases:
1, (n, n, n), validate  it to ATA_LPM_UNKNOWN;
2, (n, n, y), validate  it to  ATA_LPM_MIN_POWER_WITH_PARTIAL/ATA_LPM_MIN_POWER?
3, (n, y, n), validate  it to ATA_LPM_MIN_POWER;
4, (n, y, y), validate  it to ATA_LPM_MIN_POWER;
5, (y, n, n), validate  it to ATA_LPM_MED_POWER;
6, (y, n, y), validate  it to ATA_LPM_MIN_POWER_WITH_PARTIAL;
7, (y, y, n), default user policy;
8, (y, y, y), default user policy;
('y' for support, 'n' for not support)

for case 2, I'm not quiet sure, for which may enable hipm partial/slumber.

The way I provided above is quiet complicated and may be incomplete.
It may not be realistic to take all into account, but I think case 1 should
be taken seriously for which may cause the above PORT_IRQ_PHYRDY issue.

Perhaps, I could refer to Mario's patches later (I have not found yet on
kernel/git ^_^).
