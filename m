That is why the function returns doing nothing if ata_dev_power_init_tf()
returns false, meaning "do not do power management". See that function. It
includes ATAPI devices (e.g. CD/DVD) which do not have power management.

Define a device flag to indicate that the drive has PUIS "on" and so woke up in
standby, e.g. ATA_DFLAG_PUIS_STANDBY. Check that flag in
ata_dev_power_set_active(), similarly to the ATA_DFLAG_SLEEPING flag and return
doing nothing if the puis flag is set. Way easier than playing games with the
return value.

See above.

Please separate handling of sleep and puis. The former can be used even if puis
is off.
