I fully agree with all you said. ATA suspend/resume was badly impacted by the
switch to asynchronous PM operations and the scsi layer using the regular PM ops
instead of its own. The problems come from the fact that there is no direct link
between the scsi device and ata device (and ata port/host device). As a result,
the asynchronous PM ops ordering (parent then child for suspend and reverse for
resume) does not happen and mess things up. This rather ugly "fix" is the
smallest I could think of to quickly address the multiple regressions that were
signaled by users.

This definitely needs a proper cleanup on top. Your suggestion above makes sense
and is definitely needed as the scsi START STOP UNIT command on resume is really
useless. There are also some strange things happening with stopping on shutdown
that I have noticed as well (e.g. cache flush failing), which I now suspect
happen for the same reason as this resume issue: PM operation ordering. So I
believe that a proper fix must also include creating correct device links
between ATA and scsi devices so that PM ordering works again.

This is at the top of my to-do list. Working on it.
