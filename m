As you can see, it doesn't work. But I noticed something:
With commit reverted, initially it's not working and, after a reset, sets=
 speed to 1.5Gbps and then the port multiplier is detected. When each por=
t is scanned, speed is set to 3.0 Gbps and it works fine like that.
If the commit is NOT reverted, SATA speed is never limited and port multi=
plier is never detected.

--- commit reverted, no patch ---
