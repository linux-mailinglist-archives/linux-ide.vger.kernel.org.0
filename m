Please accept my apology if my mode of contacting you will in any way offend 
you,i understand my approach maybe very clumsy and rude.I am very cheerful, 
kind and positive man, and I am currently looking for a relationship in 
which I feel loved. i hope you will be kind enough to tell me more about 
yourself, if you don't mind..


Hope to hear from you soon.


Regards,


Wesley.
