Yes, we could do that. I minimized the changes here since this is a bug fix.

This is an odd one. Indeed, ACS defines it as N/A or alignment error, but up to
SAT-3, its translation to sense data says "This condition is not considered an
error". The libata-scsi code has this defined as a recovered error since
forever, so I did not change it. SAT4 onward do not even define a translation
for this at all.

For modern drives, this is all almost completely irrelevant anyway as we get
sense data, unless there is a big issue with the drive preventing that, which is
the case this patch is for so that we do not get the non-sensical "unaligned error".

If you have a look at SAT specifications, you'll see that most of the error bits
translation in this function are "completely made up", or rather, as the SAT
specs allows, based on the 3ware driver translation (as noted in the comment for
the error table).

I do not want to hit regressions with excessive cleaning of this code, so I just
let it be.
