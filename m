It's up to you all, if you think the patch is correct, keep it for now.
I had review comments on it yesterday here:
	https://lore.kernel.org/all/YfQSdJgi4x5hN3Ee@kroah.com/

but it seems like it might be right.

I have contacted the university again, and they privately apologized and
have said they will stop contributing until the process we worked on is
in place.  Someone decided to ignore their administration's rules here
it seems :(

thanks,
