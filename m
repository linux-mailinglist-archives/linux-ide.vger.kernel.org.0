This motherboard looks to be AMD chipset, so I assume AMD AHCI controller.

Could you send the output of:

$ lspci -nn | grep -E "SATA|AHCI"

From your logs, it looks like you have a single AHCI controller,
so it is very surprising if LPM works by simply moving the drive to
another port (on the same controller).


Sure, AHCI does allow supporting DevSleep only on certain ports,
but AFAICT all other LPM supported bits are in the CAP register,
which is the same for all ports.

But

1) If there was a port that didn't support it, we would have seen
a "port does not support device sleep" print.

2) The prints from dmesg shows lpm-pol 3, so DevSleep is not enabled.

So the settings should be the same for all ports.


Kind regards,
Niklas
