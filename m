I think that in this case the issue isn't the correctness of the
devm_kzalloc() allocation test itself, but rather the context in which
it's made in:

         host = ata_host_alloc(dev, 1);
         if (!host)
                 return -ENOMEM;
         ap = host->ports[0];

         ap->ops = devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(*ap->ops), GFP_KERNEL);
         if (!ap->ops)
                 return -ENOMEM;

My reading of ata_host_alloc() is that it allocates a refcounted 'struct
ata_host', but due to how we handle the failure of the following
devm_kzalloc(), we will never invoke ata_host_release() because the ref
won't be dropped anywhere.

So yes, the patch looks correct in the context shown by the patch
itself, but once we look at the entire function I think it's incorrect
(or, at least, I would expect more reasoning beyond "the static checker
told us so" around why it might be correct in the patch message itself
if I'm wrong).
