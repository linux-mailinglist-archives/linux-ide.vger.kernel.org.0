Are you using drives with HPA ? (host protected area, see:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_protected_area).

That normally is drive dependent, not adapter dependent. And with TCG now, HPA
is not really a thing anymore and not used on any recent drive (that I know of
at least).

Could you try with recent drives (HDDs or SSDs) that do not have HPA ? And maybe
also try to see if the libata argument "ata_ignore_hpa=1" helps.

You could also try adding a horkage for that HPA drive (see
ATA_HORKAGE_BROKEN_HPA examples in libata-core.c, ata_device_blacklist array).
Note to self: there is unfortunately no libata.force= argument for hpa. Will
need to add that.
