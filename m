Revalidation is needed to make sure that the device settings did not change, or
that the device itself did not change. This must be done before we start using
the drive again on a system resume or on a port runtime resume.

The current code always revalidates the devices attached to a port on system
resume, unless the port was runtime suspended. If the port was runtime
suspended, then revalidation will be done on runtime resume.

The main issue here which make things messy is the fact that the PM ops are
defined for the port, not for the device. Separating things would be cleaner,
but I think that is extremely hard to do considering the cases where we have
multiple devices per port. For these cases, setting the link speed etc may
depend on all the devices responding. So leaving some devices sleeping may be
very dangerous to do.

I commented on that. Your patch has a deadlock path.

udisks2 issues passthrough commands, no ? We do not parse these currently, and
we will *not* start doing that. For other operations like sync etc which end up
as a FLUSH CACHE command, or any other command that require medium access,
triggering EH when we prepare these commands in the submission path is not
nice. Not even sure that can work. That may need some significant changes to work.

Well, I do not see that happening. "cat
/sys/class/ata_port/ataX/power/runtime_status" always says "unsupported" on my
system. So not sure how you can get that... The only "link" between a scsi disk
device and an ata_port device is created by libata with the RPM_ACTIVE flag
which runs pm_runtime_get_sync() on the supplier, that is, the ata_port. So I
do not see how runtime suspend could ever work for a port as-is.

The fact that you seem to be seeing a different behavior than me kind of
indicates that something is still broken with the runtime port management. Not
sure what exactly. Could you send me your kernel config please ? I would like
to see if using that I get a different behavior. Also, what are your ata
adapters (vendor/model) ?
