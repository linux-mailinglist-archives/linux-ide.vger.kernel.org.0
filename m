I don't think such a reliable association with rev-id exists, the
intent was that the OS need never consider PCS. The way Linux is using
it is already broken with the assumption that it is performed after
every HOST_CTL based reset which only resets mmio space. At most it
should only be required at initial PCI discovery iff platform firmware
failed to run. There are no bug reports with the current
implementation that only attempts to enable bits based on PORTS_IMPL,
so I think we are firmer ground trying to draw a line where the driver
just stops worrying about PCS rather than try to detect the layout.
