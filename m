Hello,

The tests were ok, see below.

Yes, and forgot to mention that it happens usually very soon (see the
time stamps in the kernel log I sent earlier),  and consistently every
time I have tried.

Yes, zero errors with either with ATA_QUIRK_NO_LPM or 6.8.x.

I upgraded from 3611 to 3621 and the lspci output didn't change.
