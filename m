To avoid some confusion in this patch set, I want to explain it here.
The patch set involves two LPM related issues, one for the ahci adapter
does not support LPM (no partial & slumber & devslp), the other for
ahci adapter supports part of LPM(eg, only partial, no slumber & devslp).

The former case is what I metioned in this mail thread. Namely, when LPM is
enabled, actions trying to enable this unsupported feature will be failed,
but will disable PORT_IRQ_PHYRDY bit at the beginning of the ahci_set_lpm()
function, which would make PhyRdy Changed cannot be detected. So I add flags
in the ata_eh_set_lpm() function which will not go to the disable operation.

The latter case is what I metioned in "PATCH[2/2]". Namely, if the ahci
adapter only supports partial (no slumber & devslp), then when LPM is enabled
(eg, min_power), *device* initiated power mode transitions will be enabled
with the scontrol register bits setting to indicate no restrictions on LPM
transitions. After that, if SSD/HDD sends a DIPM slumber request, it cannot
be disallowed by ahci adpter for driver not setting scontrol register bits
properly. So I add flags to control it.

Therefore, Mario's patches in the sata_link_scr_lpm() function may fix the
issue in "PATCH[2/2]".

Revisit ata_scsi_lpm_store() to prevent the user from setting an unsupported
policy may be a way to fix the issue in "PATCH[1/2]", but there may be another
case where some operating system manufacturers setting LPM default enable in
driver, like the following code in the ahci_init_one() function, also need to
control.

	if (ap->flags & ATA_FLAG_EM)
		ap->em_message_type = hpriv->em_msg_type;

+        ap->target_lpm_policy = ATA_LPM_MIN_POWER;
	 ahci_update_initial_lpm_policy(ap, hpriv);

According to my current understanding, the currently submitted patches can
solve the above problems, and definitely not the best. I haven't figured out
good way to use CAP flags to patch. Hope you can give me some advice, thanks.
