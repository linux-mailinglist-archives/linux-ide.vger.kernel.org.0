On first review, I think it is OK because there is one scsi host per port. So
when ata_scsi_user_scan() with ID 100, the shost passed to it corresponds to an
ata_port that is for that device ID 100, and then ata_find_dev() changing devno
from 100 to 0 is correct.

But that "one shost == one port" seems to be correct only for pure libata, that
is, AHCI and other SATA/PATA adapters. For libsas, I am not so sure: the initial
"ap = ata_shost_to_port(shost)" in ata_scsi_user_scan() seems totally bogus for
the libsas case, while it is clearly OK for AHCI... Hmm... Needs more digging.
