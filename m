There is no way to answer CHECK POWER MODE and say the drive is in
sleep.  It can only be either active, or standby, so standby is the
closest fit.  At least it gets smartd and udisks2 to leave the drive
alone.

I'm not sure what you propose be done instead.  Regardless, this is how
it has always been done, so I don't think there is any changing it now.
You also have the legacy standby timer that is exposed to users through
udisks2/gnome-disk-utility that still has to be supported.

I'd eventually like to as well, but it should also work in kernels that
aren't built with runtime pm enabled.

That sounds like broken firmware to me.  When you ask the firmware to
power off the system, it should really be powered off.

I'm not sure the filesystem maintainers will see it that way.  They
generally issue barriers as part of a commit at regular intervals, and
that gets turned into FLUSH CACHE.  Also the kernel issues one during
system suspend, and I think that happens even if no filesystem is
mounted.  I think systemd also issues a sync() during shutdown, which
would wake up a sleeping disk only to shut down.

I don't think it is up to all of these other sources to be patched to
avoid this.  libata knows the disk is in sleep mode, so that is the
place to handle it.

I don't see the connection.  If the FS issues IO in the background, the
disk will wake up, just like it does when in standby.  The faking of the
commands simply replicates the behavior you get from standby in sleep
mode.  With this patch, as far as anyone can tell, a sleeping disk is
exactly the same as one in standby.
