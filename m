Well, if my understanding is right when ATA_FLAG_SATA is not set then
it means it is a PATA controller.
So if someone has a PATA device that supports READ_LOG_DMA then it
would be disabled even in that case, but I had the impression
that command is new enough for this to be not very likely (and
I am guessing most PATA users care more about things working
than getting the best possible performance).

This is a bit off-topic for the patch, so you can leave me to try and
figure it out myself, but I am afraid your explanation does not quite
add up to me:

Hm, I see that might have been the intent, but that does not seem to be
the case.
The condition is:
> if (dev->dma_mode &&
However the correct way to check is to use ata_dma_enabled.
Which is:
return (adev->dma_mode == 0xFF ? 0 : 1);
So kind of the opposite (actually I think dev->dma_mode is always true),
and matching that ata_bus_probe sets dev->dma_mode = 0xff;
Now ata_do_set_mode would set up the proper value, but the little
problem is that that one is never called for SATA (and quite a few
PATA?) controllers.
So it seems there is no working way to detect if dma is enabled or not?
Unless the initialization value after reset would need to depend on
the controller, setting it to 0xff for no dma for PATA and some "random"
UDMA setting (or a newly added DMA_SATA one) for SATA controllers?

A typical log looks as below, now I admit it is very confusing because
it says the mode is 6.0 Gbps which is not even possible with PATA,
so not really clear which mode is active at which point.
However I think that DMA is only properly up after ata_do_set_mode (however
that is not used at all by most controllers it seems?), which
is the "failed to set xfermode", however that is long after the
"READ LOG DMA EXT failed".
