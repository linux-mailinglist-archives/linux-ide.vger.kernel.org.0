It should be ready for testing:
https://github.com/floatious/linux/tree/external-port-v2

With this, you should no longer need:
for foo in /sys/class/scsi_host/host*/link_power_management_policy;
  do echo med_power_with_dipm > $foo;
done

(Assuming you have compiled your kernel with CONFIG_SATA_MOBILE_LPM_POLICY=3).

After issuing hdparm -Y /dev/sdb I saw lower transitions down to pc8 right away without(!) issuing the same command for sda. So maybe fd3a6837d8e1 isn't the culprit after all. I'll keep testing.

You shouldn't need to do:
$ hdparm -Y

As that bypasses some of the internal logic in libata.

I assume that you didn't need this on v6.6 and older?

(Instead libata should put the device to standby or sleep itself,
it shouldn't need to be done explicitly by the user.)

How certain are you that v6.6 works?

Could it be the same problem there, that it works sometimes and doesn't
work sometimes?

The reason why I'm asking is that Damien's major changes got included
in v6.6-rc4:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-ide/20230929133324.164211-1-dlemoal@kernel.org/

So I would be less surprised if you said that you can enter pc8 on every
boot on v6.5, but on v6.6 it only works occasionally.

But if you can enter pc8 on every boot on v6.6, but not on v6.7,
then it is probably easier to figure out which commit that broke
things, as there were not that many suspend/resume related changes
added in v6.7.


Kind regards,
Niklas
