I'm truly sorry for not replying to you sooner.
For some reason my corporate email managed to put all emails from bugzilla in
the spam folder.

The proper mailing list is:
linux-ide@vger.kernel.org

I've added it to this email. You can just reply all to this email, no need to
describe your problem again.

For what it is worth, Damien has sent out a series that reverts
the commit that you managed to bisect your regression to:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-ide/20240111115123.1258422-1-dlemoal@kernel.org/T/#t

Your help testing the series would be much appreciated.

I see. You have built your kernel with CONFIG_SATA_MOBILE_LPM_POLICY=3,
however we still see:
ata5: SATA max UDMA/133 abar m2048@0x42233000 port 0x42233300 irq 124 lpm-pol 0

lpm-pol 0 at boot.

The reason for this can only be that your AHCI controller is not marked to
support LPM:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.7/drivers/ata/ahci.c#L1629-L1631

Perhaps you could show the output of:
$ lspci -nn | grep AHCI

I guess one option could be to either add (or modify if there already is an
entry) your AHCI controller's PCI device and vendor id to the list of supported
AHCI controllers:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.7/drivers/ata/ahci.c#L278

And use "board_ahci_low_power" instead of "board_ahci".

See e.g.:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/ata/ahci.c?id=b8b8b4e0c052b2c06e1c4820a8001f4e0f77900f


That way, you should not need to do any:

for foo in /sys/class/scsi_host/host*/link_power_management_policy;
  do echo med_power_with_dipm > $foo;
done

in order for your system to enter lower power states.

In fact, it would be interesting to know if that alone solves your problem,
or if you still need the revert/Damien's recent patch series as well.

I see, so your AHCI port does not support DevSleep.

I see.
You shouldn't need "echo med_power_with_dipm",
you should have an entry in ahci.c with "board_ahci_low_power" instead.


You also shouldn't need to do
$ hdparm -Y

It would be interesting to know if it is enough to only apply only
the first patch in Damien's series:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-ide/20240111115123.1258422-2-dlemoal@kernel.org/
or if you need to apply both.

Ok, this shows us that DevSleep is not enabled in the devices,
so it appears that your system does not need DevSleep to enter
lower power states, but it probably needs some other LPM feature
that is enabled by ata_eh_set_lpm() (since when lpm-pol is 0,
ata_eh_set_lpm() is never called, and this is when it doesn't work,
yet when you force a different lpm-pol using sysfs, ata_eh_set_lpm()
will get called and you appear to be able to enter lower power states.

It seems quite clear right now that the ports on your AHCI controller
does not support DevSleep, yet your system still appears to be able to
enter lower power states anyway (if ata_eh_set_lpm() is allowed to
run to enable partial/slumber and DIPM).

There doesn't appear to be an option to disable/enable an arbitrary
feature using hdparm.

Anyway, there is no need, as you have already shown that DevSleep feature
is not enabled on your devices.


Kind regards,
Niklas
