It might be, you'll have to ask people to help you, very rarely do people
just test patches unsolicited unless they have some sort of interest in the
feature.

This is all part of what it takes to get code upstream. Writing the code
is just a small part of it, the bigger part is usually getting it tested
and providing some assurance that you are willing to fix issues when/if
they come up.

You might want to consider splitting up the patchset a bit - you could
have one patch for the generic bits, then one for each chipset. That
would allow you to at least get some of the work upstream, once tested.
