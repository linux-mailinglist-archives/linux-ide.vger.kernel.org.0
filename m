Good point. I will look into adding this.

:)

I have a e-sata port-multiplier box in the lab. But I need to hook it up to my
test box, which means that I have to get out of home for once and go to the
office :) Will do that. Port-multiplier tests are also needed to complete Hannes
series renaming sysfs fields to match the debug messages.
