No, this has to be oneOf. See for example
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio-vf610.yaml or many other files.

OK, then let's skip them now. The clock items should be described if it
is possible.

You cannot have infinite number of interrupts... What suggests "1+"?
What does it mean "as interrupts suggests"? Do these hardware blocks
really have many interrupt lines?

The same for phys.

`git grep ports-implemented` gives pretty straightfoward answer. All DTS
have u32 and driver also uses u32.

Must be. You cannot have infinite number of reset lines... Please check
all DTS and drivers. If there is public documentation, it also might be
useful.

What do you mean "name suggests"? Name of property? No, it does not
suggest that. Name is standard. Please check example schema and other
existing schema bindings to see how it is done. For example earlier
gpio-vf610.yaml is not bad.

> i know from usb subsystem (dwc3 usb3) that a device can have more than one phy, and because in the txt there are no ranges i set everywhere MinItems to 1 with open end as i do not know all possibilities. Anything else will be trial and error...for all properties

The bindings need to be specific, so only properties which really,
really can have many unknown elements we could keep here some high
maxItems limit. In 99% of cases maxItems are clearly defined.

Install dependencies (libyaml-dev) and you will see first error:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/ata/ahci-platform.yaml:110:1:
[warning] wrong indentation: expected 2 but found 0 (indentation)

But the one I am thinking is indeed not visible by default. You would
need to run it like Rob's boot is running, so add DT_CHECKER_FLAGS=-m.
Then you see:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/ata/ahci-platform.example.dt.yaml:0:0:
/example-1/sata@f7e90000: failed to match any schema with compatible:
['marvell,berlin2q-achi', 'generic-ahci']
