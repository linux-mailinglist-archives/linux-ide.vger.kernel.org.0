I don't see any checks for whether the port was previously runtime
suspended or not.  It looks to me like it unconditionally revalidates
all devices on system resume, which is why I'm trying to patch it to
defer that until runtime resume.

Ahh, right.... you mean for PATA right?  Does anyone still have any of
those these days? :)

Isn't the NORMAL time eh is triggered is in response to normal IO being
submitted?  Power management is kind of the auxiliary use of eh.

I had another patch in my old series that had libata fake several
commands rather than waking up the drive from SLEEP.  That included
IDENTIFY, FLUSH CACHE, STANDBY1_NOW, and CHECK POWER CONDITION.  Those were needed to
keep udisks or smartd from waking up the drive.

I normally cd -P /sys/block/sda, which gets me into what appears to be
the scsi lun.  Going up a few directories through the scsi target, scsi
host, and finally to the ataX, I find that node's power/control is
set to on, and if I change it to auto, then dmesg shows the port doing
runtime suspend and resume.  I think there was another ata_port
subdirectory in there somewhere, maybe that's the one you're looking at?
I'm not sure what the difference is between ata8 and ata8/ata_port/ata8,
but I think the latter did not support runtime pm, so I'm guessing that
is the one you are looking at.

I'll try to get you the config tonight.  My internal drives are on an
Intel AHCI controller built into the southbridge of my chipset.  My
external drives are on another cheap AHCI eSATA controller I got, since
the Intel doesn't support hotplug or PMP iirc.
