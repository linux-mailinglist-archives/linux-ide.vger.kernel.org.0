Short story:
I was thinking about this a lot, and unfortunately I came to the conclusion
that we cannot with good conscience write such a workaround.

The reason is that we would increase the power usage on all SATA ports that
have no devices connected to them at boot, not just for his controller, but
for all SATA controller all around the world, just to have a workaround for
this non-spec compliant SATA Blu-Ray player.
(The reason is that would not be able to offline the port, which will shut
down the PHY).

I suggest that your user simply does:
# echo max_performance > /sys/class/scsi_host/host3/link_power_management_policy
or
$ sudo sh -c "echo max_performance > /sys/class/scsi_host/host3/link_power_management_policy"



Long story:
Each port can be marked External or Hotplug capable by firmware, if so,
ahci_update_initial_lpm_policy() will override the configured
CONFIG_SATA_MOBILE_LPM_POLICY and set it to 0.
(This is because hotplug and LPM are mutually exclusive.)

In this case, the lpm-pol is printed as 3 for all ports, this means that
CONFIG_SATA_MOBILE_LPM_POLICY was set to 3, and that none of the ports
were marked as external or hotplug capable by firmware.

Note that even though the target LPM policy is printed early in the boot,
the actual enablement of LPM is not done now, that is done _after_ all
devices have been detected.

Note that when the AHCI driver is loaded, it will call ahci_reset_controller(),
which does a HBA reset, which will implicitly send a COMRESET to all ports.

Thus, when we dump PxSSTS (SStatus), all ports have already been reset once,
and we can see that:

0h No device detected and Phy communication not established
1h Device presence detected but Phy communication not established
3h Device presence detected and Phy communication established
4h Phy in offline mode as a result of the interface being disabled
   or running in a BIST loopback mode

This is stored in the lowest hex value, so:
ata3: 0x3
ata5: 0x3
ata6: 0x4
ata4: 0x0

After sending a wakeup to force all devices to active mode,
there was no change (this was extra test code added by me).

After reset, we still don't see ata4 moving to 0x3.
From the controller perspective, there is nothing plugged in.

On ata3, which did detect a device presence, we see a WDC drive.
After this, we will call set_lpm() for port ata3. Since the LPM policy is 0x3,
we will disable hotplug IRQ (since low power modes are and hotplug are mutually
exclusive).

On ata6, we don't detect any device.
After this, we will call set_lpm() for port ata6. Since the LPM policy is 0x3,
we will disable hotplug IRQ (since low power modes are and hotplug are mutually
exclusive). Because there is no device detected, we will also offline the port,
to save even more power. (Since the port is not external or hotplug capable,
we know that there can never come a device later.)

On ata4, we don't detect any device.
After this, we will call set_lpm() for port ata4. Since the LPM policy is 0x3,
we will disable hotplug IRQ (since low power modes are and hotplug are mutually
exclusive). Because there is no device detected, we will also offline the port,
to save even more power (since the port is not external or hotplug capable,
we know that there can never come a device later).

On ata5, which did detect a device presence, we see a Samsung drive.
Looking up at this device string in our list of quirks, wee see that this
device does not handle low power states very well, we therefore override
the LPM policy for the port that this device is connected to to max_power 0x0).
After this, we will call set_lpm() for port ata5. Since the LPM policy is 0x0,
we will not disable the hotplug IRQ.



This seem to be in line with AHCI "10.1.1 Firmware Specific Initialization",
step 5.

"""
Wait for a positive indication that a device is attached to the port (the
maximum amount of time to wait for presence indication is specified in the
Serial ATA Revision 2.6 specification). This is done by polling PxSSTS.DET.
If PxSSTS.DET returns a value of 1h or 3h when read, then system software
shall continue to the next step, otherwise if the polling process times out
system software moves to the next implemented port and returns to step 1.
"""



Note that the Samsung drive is not well behaved, as it does not handle low
power modes very well, that is why we quirk it.
But in order to be able to quirk a device, you need to actually have a
working communication with the device. (And a COMRESET is supposed to
re-initialize communication).

We can not quirk the Blu-Ray device, since it does not seem to reply to
a COMRESET.

Perhaps there is a firmware update for this device?

Feel free to write to LG or whoever creates this device and we will be
happy help out as best as we can.



Kind regards,
Niklas
