Sorry for the confusion.

The sata_mv driver is (only) responsible for the SoC-Sata-II adapter. As far as I know,
however, this is _not_ connected via PCI(-E). I can't tell you exactly how, but in 
the product brief of the SoC it says that it is realized via a "System Crossbar".

88F6281 SoC Block diagram on page very first page:
https://web.archive.org/web/20160428131639/http://www.marvell.com/embedded-processors/kirkwood/assets/88F6192-003_ver1.pdf

The 88SE6121 controller _is_ connected via PCIE.

I tried the pata_marvell driver for all kernels (2.x, 3.x, 6.x) but it never
succeeded to find the drives. It immediately exits (no "fail to IDENTIFY", just nothing).

The U-Boot bootloader successfully starts the drives with the AHCI driver:

lspci output starts at line 609 of the file I linked the last time:

The bug report (https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216094) also has other
logs, e.g. /sys/bus/pci/devices/*/ Linux 6.2.0-rc5:

I do not think that two drivers are conflicting here.
