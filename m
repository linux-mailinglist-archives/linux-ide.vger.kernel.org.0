Yes, I meant to say that you should not see any timeout/long pause with NCQ for
a max command size of 1MiB. The reason I say that is that most drive managed SMR
implementation are based on some form of logging of random writes. Logging small
writes is fast and relatively easy to handle (even if the log is full, a small
portion of it can be recovered with just a few IOs). But if the writes are
large, things can get ugly as freeing up enough space in that log can be very
costly. That of course all depend on the vendor/model implementation of device
managed SMR FW...

My point was to try NCQ combined with a small max sectors quirk to see if that
works well or not.

You will need to reboot without libata.force=noncq. Otherwise,
ata_dev_config_ncq() will always do nothing for the drive and NCQ will not be
seen as supported.

Once you confirm if we really need to maintain NCQ off or not with a small max
sectors limit, we can write a proper quirk for this drive.
