I've already reported the issue here:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219296
and unfortunately the issue exists also on 6.11.

I did it and placed the log from bisect in my bugzilla report: 
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219296

I was trying to report this issue to American Megatrends Inc. as the 
BIOS maintainer but their website form didn't accept any of my emails :) 
So eventually I couldn't let them know about these issues.

Please take a look at bugzilla report: 
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219296 - there are the details.

I'm wondering what is the better way for communication - here on mailing 
list or put the comments in bugzilla ticket?
Probably here will be better idea...
