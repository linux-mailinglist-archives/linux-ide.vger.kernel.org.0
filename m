I am strongly against reverting that fix/improvement because of a problem with a
badly broken hardware that does not respect the AHCI specifications. Such
regression was bound to happen with such hardware and likely will happen again
in the future if we touch anything that does not fit with the adapters weird use
of PMP or other feature. I do not want libata code to be stuck as it is for fear
of breaking support for adapters that are already broken in the first place...

So let's go the other way around and add a libata.force parameter that allows
disabling the port count fix, or allows specifying a port mask. That will allow
users of these broken adapters to get them running again. Ideally, we would use
a quirk but it seems that the same controller chip is used in both correct
setups and broken-PMP setups. So unless ASMedia indicates some black-magic
register we can look at to know what to do, it will have to be a "manual" module
parameter.
