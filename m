And, to make matters ever more complicated, the error and status bits 
changed over time. And even the SAT translation changed between versions.
So there really is no clear "that's the way to go" style of thing; if we 
want to be correct we would need to evaluate the ATA version for that 
device, and have different translation tables depending on the version.

Not sure if it's worth it, though; in the end it's just an error 
description which will get changed. Commands will be aborted in either 
case, so the net result is close to zero :-)

Hannes
