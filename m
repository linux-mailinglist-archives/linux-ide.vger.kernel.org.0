Ah. OK. Then the answer is no, there is a possibility that the patches
break the detection of drives with some adapters. Most likely with old
systems. This is not 100% safe.

But the alternative is to keep the delays as is and keep patching as you
did for disabling the delays on systems that are identified as OK. And I
do not like this alternative either since I suspect that the majority of
recent drives+AHCI adapters will be OK.

I keep looking at the code to see how to reduce the risks. However, since
the code being patched runs before we even know what drive is connected,
we cannot for example rely on the drive specs version (old drive =3D=3D o=
ld
specs).

The safe approach will be to mark most adapters with
ATA_LFLAG_DEBOUNCE_DELAY and remove that flag for tested adapters, which
will be easier to do with the libata.force changes, which will allow
specifying "nodebounce_delay".

The problem though is that there are lots of AHCI adapters that do not
have an specific entry in ahci_port_info and use the default entry.
Changing that one is the main risk.

Still looking at the code to see what can be done to minimize that.
