Well, that is simply not how PMP works.

For PMP to be supported the HBA needs to set CAP.SPM (Supports Port Muliplier).
(This also implies Command-based switching is supported.)

The HBA can additionally set CAP.FBSS (FIS-based Switching Supported),
if CAP.SPM is set.

If CAP.SPM is set, you can plug in a PMP to each of the ports.
Each PMP can support a max of 15 ports.

If PMP is enabled, you fill in the port number behind the port when
queuing the command:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.8/drivers/ata/libahci.c#L1424
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.8/drivers/ata/libata-sata.c#L154


Looking at your SATA HBA:
> [    0.608537] ahci 0000:04:00.0: AHCI 0001.0301 32 slots 24 ports 6 Gbps 0xffff0f impl SATA mode
> [    0.608540] ahci 0000:04:00.0: flags: 64bit ncq sntf stag pm led only pio sxs deso sadm sds apst

We can see that it does not support PMP at all.
There is no "pmp" in print, which means that CAP.SPM was not set.

So your HBA does not support PMP, sorry.


Yes, we can see that it claims that it has 24 ports from the print, so it
appears that they have implemented their own version of PMP that is not
compatible with AHCI. Lovely :)



I think this brings more questions than answers...

What is the PCI device and vendor ID for this device?

You said that this is a PCIe card with a ASM1064 and two port multipliers
on the same PCIe card?

From what we've heard before, a ASMedia card with 4 physical slots,
like this card:
https://www.newegg.com/p/17Z-0061-000B5

Has PCIe device and vendor ID:
{ PCI_VDEVICE(ASMEDIA, 0x1064), board_ahci },   /* ASM1064 */

But you have a PCIe card with the same device and vendor ID,
but your card also has 2 port multipliers with 4 ports each?

Well, I guess it should be fine to use the PCI device and vendor ID
for the underlying HBA... considering that devices connected to the
ports are supposed to be discoverable...

If they only claimed that the HBA supported PMP, the Linux device
driver would try to enumerate the devices behind the PMP according
to the standard.

See AHCI 1.3.1, section 9.2 Port Multiplier Enumeration.
Or
SATA-IO - Port Multiplier 1.0, 7.4.2 Device Enumeration.

The PMP standard also describes how you read the device and vendor
ID of the PMP.


Right now, they AMedia? seem to have their own home-made PMP implementation.


Could you try the attached patch on top of v6.8, to see if Linux
can detect the devices behind the two JMB575 PMPs?

If that works, we could still support PMP (according to the standard),
and people with a ASM1064 PCIe card that does not have any port multipliers
on the PCIe card would not suffer from significantly increased boot times.

I guess a second step would be to see if ASM1064 also supports
FIS-based switching.

https://www.asmedia.com.tw/product/A58yQC9Sp5qg6TrF/58dYQ8bxZ4UR9wG5

Simply says "Supported port multiplier command based switching",
it doesn't seem to mention FIS-based switching... so I guess not?
(If it did, libata already has a AHCI_HFLAG_YES_FBS for other broken HBAs.)


Kind regards,
Niklas
