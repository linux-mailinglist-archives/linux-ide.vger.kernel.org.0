Any SATA device that supports sense reporting feature, including ZAC devices,
can still get sense data for failed commands.

This case is for the weird CDL aborts with policy 0xD which will fail a command
that exceeds its limits with a success status and sense data available bit set
in the SDB (which translate to ATA_SENSE flag). So for commands using CDL,
getting a success with ATA_SENSE set most likely means that the command was
aborted by the drive.

So this is not the regular error case. We still use EH to get that sense data
from the "sense data for successful NCQ command log" though, because otherwise
we can run into problems if we do not have a free tag.
