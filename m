I think you are mixing things up, we don't have any ap->cdl.

We have:
1) ap->ncq_sense_buf	(u8 *ncq_sense_buf)
2) dev->cdl		(u8 cdl[ATA_LOG_CDL_SIZE])
3) ap->sector_buf	(u8 sector_buf[ATA_SECT_SIZE])

I do not think there is any bug in having ap->ncq_sense_buf in struct ata_port,
like the code currently does, because like you say, we currently only fetch the
Successful NCQ Commands log from EH context, so this should be safe even when
using PMPs.

For dev->cdl, it is currently in struct ata_device, which is correct, because
as you say, caching the CDL descriptor log page in the ata_port would not be
correct, since it could then get overwritten by another device if using a PMP.
(Changing this to be dynamically allocated would be a nice optimization.)

For ap->sector_buf, I suggested to perhaps move this to ata_device, such that
the ata_read_log() functions (which already take a ata_device as first
argument) do no longer need to take a "buffer" argument, the buffer could be
derived from the ata_device if we move the buffer there.

If we move ap->sector_buf to struct ata_device, then I think that it makes
sense to also move ap->ncq_sense_buf to struct ata_device.


Kind regards,
Niklas
