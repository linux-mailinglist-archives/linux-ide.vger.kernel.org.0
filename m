So, I guess the current conclusion is that there's no optimal solution
due to hardware not following the standards?
I also thought about the option to use override parameters like
setting the port mask. But then I also thought about: How to handle a
system with different HBAs?
Like a system using one card with a pci-e multiplexer but also a card
like mine with port multipliers. The result would be either the
current behaviour - all ports working but long timeouts - or like with
the change - no timeouts but not all ports working.
An optimal solution would requite a per-HBA setting. To keep a
consistent order the address path could be used, like "the first HBA
is on pci-e_3, the second on pci-e_5". It would still be up to the
user to correctly identify the correct ports and set up a working
kernel command but at least it would be an option for mixed systems to
set parameters per controller instead of applying the same setting
global.

I searched for both host controllers as well as port multipliers.
Although most solutions end up with controllers from ASMedia, JMicron
or even SLI there seem also way more lesser known chips out there.
I also searched for more details around all that topic - and was able
to find older forum threads from 2008 to 2013. So this seem to already
going on for several years (hence I not really understood the initial
report about the long boot timeout as I thought "well, people deal
with it for over a decade now").

Aside from the revert is in my favour I also see that there're some
deeper issues that either have to be ignored potentially breaking
hardware, tried to worked around with (would a separate driver be
possible?) or to get in contact with major controller manufactures to
get them to come up with changes for newer chips/firmware - this way
at least new hardware can have a chance to work out of the box by
following the standards.

Quite a complicated topic.
