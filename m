Yikes.

Yes, but without async PM ops, the IDENTIFY command that was not
preceeded by a VERIFY worked just fine, right?

Right, it won't CAUSE the drive to spin up, but if it is already in the
process of spinning up ( due to the reset ), then the drive will finish
spinning up before answering the IDENTIFY command.  Or do you think that
some drives may handle the IDENTIFY wrong if they are still in the
process of spinning up?
