Out of most bad things come something good :)

I've been reading up on LPM in SATA + AHCI specs because of this,
so some of the patches related to LPM probably wouldn't have been
submitted if it wasn't for this :)

The amout of comments needed to describe how "out of the ordinary"
something is, is probably a sign that you should just do a proper

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-ide/20240209130307.39113-1-cassel@kernel.org/

So feel free to review that one instead :)


Kind regards,
