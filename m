Ah ! This is a drive-managed SMR drive ? I missed that point. Yeah, with these
drives, the performance profile (throughpu & command latency) can be all over
the place depending on the internal state of the drive. So all bets are off in
terms of timeout... In your case, this seems extreme though, so there is likely
a head going bad and lots of internal retries going on that make latency even
worse than usual. Maybe have a look at SMART output to see if you lots of bad
sectors remapped ?
