Note that devslp is a device side feature too. See ata_dev_config_devslp(=
) in
libata-core.c. So even if the adapter supports devslp, if the drive does =
not,
devslp should not be enabled on the port.

For all above cases, the default should be to use the default configured =
policy
defined by SATA_MOBILE_LPM_POLICY or the ahci module parameter but correc=
ted to
match what the adapter & device support, including the eventual NO LPM ho=
rkage
flag. Mario's patch started addressing that, but that patch can be improv=
ed
using yours.

yes.

Mario's patch is here:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220404194510.9206-2-mario.limonciello@amd.c=
om/

Can you add that patch into your series with eventual modifications to be=
tter
check the adapter's CAP bits ?

Mario ? Are you OK with that ?
