I am super confused now... The system boots fine and 2 disks (sda and sdb) are
properly detected and initialized using the sata_mv driver. This is a PCI driver
which supports these devices:

static const struct pci_device_id mv_pci_tbl[] = {
        { PCI_VDEVICE(MARVELL, 0x5040), chip_504x },
        { PCI_VDEVICE(MARVELL, 0x5041), chip_504x },
        { PCI_VDEVICE(MARVELL, 0x5080), chip_5080 },
        { PCI_VDEVICE(MARVELL, 0x5081), chip_508x },
        /* RocketRAID 1720/174x have different identifiers */
        { PCI_VDEVICE(TTI, 0x1720), chip_6042 },
        { PCI_VDEVICE(TTI, 0x1740), chip_6042 },
        { PCI_VDEVICE(TTI, 0x1742), chip_6042 },

        { PCI_VDEVICE(MARVELL, 0x6040), chip_604x },
        { PCI_VDEVICE(MARVELL, 0x6041), chip_604x },
        { PCI_VDEVICE(MARVELL, 0x6042), chip_6042 },
        { PCI_VDEVICE(MARVELL, 0x6080), chip_608x },
        { PCI_VDEVICE(MARVELL, 0x6081), chip_608x },

        { PCI_VDEVICE(ADAPTEC2, 0x0241), chip_604x },

        /* Adaptec 1430SA */
        { PCI_VDEVICE(ADAPTEC2, 0x0243), chip_7042 },

        /* Marvell 7042 support */
        { PCI_VDEVICE(MARVELL, 0x7042), chip_7042 },

        /* Highpoint RocketRAID PCIe series */
        { PCI_VDEVICE(TTI, 0x2300), chip_7042 },
        { PCI_VDEVICE(TTI, 0x2310), chip_7042 },

        { }                     /* terminate list */
};

Given that sata_mv is a PCI device, I fail to see how this can even work before
you load pci-mvebu, which if I am not mistaken is the PCI controller driver for
Marvell SoCs.

sata_mv is NOT an ahci driver... So I suspect that doing the "modprobe
pci-mvebu" loaded another ata driver, which uses libahci or is the generic ahci
driver. And we also have the pata_marvell driver which handles the pata port,
but I assume that you do not have that one compiled, right ?

> 3. Some interrupt und lspci info.

I did not see lspci information in the bugzilla, and I wanted to look at it to
understand the ATA adapters present. What you attached is the output of (ls
/sys/bus/pci/devices/*/). Can you please send the output of "lspci" and "lspci -n" ?

It looks like 2 drivers are conflicting trying to manage the same thing... But I
need first to better understand the hardware setup. Can you also send the
relevant source pieces of the nas440.dtb device tree ?
