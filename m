Yeah, that was the original idea. By the time libata was designed we 
still had quite a lot of drivers in drivers/ide, and it wasn't quite 
clear if managing everything via SATL was the way to go.
So one idea was to allow libata to become stand-alone, and SATL working 
as a modular interface on top of libata.
However, this never materialized, as everyone was quite happy having to 
deal with SCSI devices only, even if that meant to go via an additional 
layer of interpolation.

With the introduction of libsas this idea became even more dubious, as 
libsas really called for a _tighter_ integration with SCSI.
Plus ATA in general seems to be heading into the sunset, so I sincerely 
doubt anyone really wants to head that way.

In fact, with the recent patches we should finally drop the pretension 
that libata will ever be standalone, and concentrate on making it more 
aligned with SCSI.

Cheers,

Hannes
