The ata device appears to be entirely internal and not exposed as part
of the sysfs device tree.  It is the generic block device that seems to
be the one that actually implements runtime pm for the disk.

I think the problem is that the ata port is resumed first, then later
the block device.  Thus, setting the block device to suspended in the
port resume is later overruled by the system resume of the block
device.  I'm thinking what is needed is for sd.c to query libata in its
system resume callback and then set the runtime pm status depending on
whether the drive is active or not.

By the way, I have noticed my system logs showing that the ata port that
my dvd+rw is on is "Activating" twice, back to back.  Any idea why it
would be trying to power up the optial drive twice?
