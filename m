I just figured it would save a little more power than just *pretending*
the drive was asleep ( which is what I did at first ).  I guess I can go
back to just setting the sleeping flag without telling the drive to
actually go to sleep.

Oh poo.  Though now I'm curious if it actually does fail on any.  It
seems like a pretty obvious thing to do and an oversight on the part of
the spec.  The kernel certainly doesn't do anything to prevent the user
from running hdparm -Y on a drive that is already in standby.

Wait, is that specifically from PuiS to sleep, or standby to sleep in general?

You mean change each if (rc == -EAGAIN) to if (ATA_DFLAG_SLEEPING)? That
doesn't seem any easier to me, but I'm not opposed to it.

Darnit, I thought I had removed all of the runtime pm stuff.  My bad.
