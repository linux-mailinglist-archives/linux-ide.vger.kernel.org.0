That would be nice.  I assume that would involve changing how
libata-scsi.c translates SYNCHRONIZE CACHE from the scsi layer?

The ATA disk internal auto standby timer, i.e. hdparm -S.

So you are saying that we need to patch the kernel to make runtime pm
work better, then patch smartd and udisks2 to check for runtime pm
before issuing their SMART commands, and patch udsisks2 to enable
runtime pm rather than using the legacy ATA standby timer?

I'm almost certain that I have seen this happen, and I don't currently
see any code in sd.c that would would prevent it from issuing a FLUSH
CACHE to a disk that is runtime suspended when the system suspends or
shuts down.

The block layer also would need patched to avoid turning a barrier into
a FLUSH CACHE if the disk is runtime suspended, and also the sync()
path.  Is that even sensible to do?  It is true that for all block
devices, their caches do not need flushed while they are runtime
suspended?  It seems like it may be, but I'm not certain.
