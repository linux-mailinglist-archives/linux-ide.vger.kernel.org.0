Perhaps if it fails, then it should set the flag to request it be tried
again?  As long as it succeeds, then there's no need to do it again?

My main issue with it was that it caused errors with my PuiS patch.  I
tried canceling the SET_ACTIVE flag when PuiS was detected, but then the
flag got turned back on for the second pass of EH, but not the flag for
revalidate_and_attach, so it didn't detect the PuiS and clear the
SET_ACTIVE flag the second time.  Since the SET FEATURES command was not
issued, the VERIFY command failed, and after the 5th attempt, eh gave
up.  Without PuiS, it would also be nice to not waste time with a second
VERIFY command.
