No, not wrong. But you are looking at the wrong layer. Do not try to prevent
flushes from being issued at the block layer level but *above* it. That is,
FSes, applications etc.

What does not work ? Everything is fine with my testing: the drive is always
woken up whenever someone (FS, applications etc) issue a block IO (including
flush) to the block layer. That is the expected behavior. If you want to have
the disk keep sleeping, the device users must stop poking at the drive.

Filesystems issue flush only if they have dirty data to flush, normally. I have
not looked at ext4/xfs code in a while, but if the FS has not committed any
transaction in the last cycle, there should be no flush issued. If there is,
then someone is reading or writing files (for reading, if you have atime
enabled, that will cause a metadata change and so a transaction commit).

See above. That is why I am telling you to run blktrace or any tracer to figure
out the command sequence and who is doing what. There is absolutely no clarity
to what you are describing and so we cannot plan for a solution.

I do not think that the periodic flush happens if nothing has been written. For
"sync", someone issues that, not the FS on its own. So trace it to find out who
is doing that.
