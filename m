I checked all SAT docs from v1 up to v5 and all of them define the same
for the device fault status bit.

1) If status device fault bit is set, ignore error and translate to
HARDWARE ERROR / INTERNAL TARGET FAILURE. So this is wrong in the current
code which returns ABORTED COMMAND / SCSI PARITY ERROR, which is a little
silly. We could fix this, but urgency for the fix seems to be non-existen=
t
since no-one complained about that one. I suspect this is because this
stuff only matters for IDE drives since most NCQ drives will get sense
data from the read log 10h anyway. So that weird stat_table is likely
never used, even for IDE drives as the sense_table gets a hit all the tim=
e
first.

3) When the status device fault bit is not set and the error bit is set,
then the error bits are defined differently across SAT revision, but they
all look backward compatible though.

3) None of the SAT specs have anything about "unaligned" error defined. I
think it is safe to remove that one as a fix. Will you send a patch ?

Peter,

Your drive seems to be an exception to my (1) statement and the error it
returns seems weird enough that the stat_table ends up being used.
Could you send a dmesg output of a failed command so that we can see the
err_mask etc info for the failed command ? And it would be good to add a
print of the drv_stat and drv_err parameters passed to
ata_to_sense_error() for the failures you are seeing. That would help
trying to figure out what your drive is attempting to signal.

Also, please send the output of "hdparm -I" for that SSD please, so that
we have information about what standard it is (supposedly) following.
