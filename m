I can confirm this. Such cards seems still always to use original vendor=20
and device id from ASMedia.
At least all my cards I had hands on it showed that.

I do also suspect this, that there is some default firmware for this.=20
Unfortunately, ASMedia won't give any firmware to end users, only=20
vendors.

It may be the difference, that my ASM1064 card is _not_ using any port=20
multipliers.
It's a Delock 90073 16 port sata controller. It contains 4x ASM1064,=20
each connected to one PCIe lane.
So hardware PCIe interface is x4.

Even, when 16 drives are connected, I can clearly see, that's its=20
waiting on other sata ports for answer and reports after some time a=20
timeout. It's not the hard drives, which are "slow". Its slow on unused=20
ports and waits for timeout. Since 4 ASM1064 are present, a total of 128=20
ports are reported. Maybe your connected port multiplier JMB575 causes,=20
that those timeout are not happening then?
