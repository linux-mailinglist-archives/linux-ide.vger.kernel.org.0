I tried before to have libata ignore the useless flush and you said to
stop the flush from happening in the first place.  Now you say that's wrong?

No, I'm working on runtime pm now, as you suggested.  If you try using
runtime pm with disks, you quickly see that it does not work.

Filesystems flush every few seconds.  So does anyone calling sync(),
which the kernel does when you suspend to ram.

Either the filesystems need to keep track of whether a flush is needed
and skip it, or if they all call the same place ( blkdev_issue_flush ),
then it only needs done once in that place.

The core logic needs to be "if nothing has been written, then nothing
needs to be flushed".  Right now filesystems just flush periodically or
when their sync method is called to make sure that anything that has
been written is stable.

In userspace you have smartd and udisks2 to worry about.  The
information they need to know is whether the disk has otherwise been in
recent use and so they should not poll the SMART data.  I don't see
anything exported in the power/ directory that would give an indication
of the current *remaining* time until autosuspend, or how long it has
been since the last access.  Either one would be useful for userspace to
decide that nobody else seems to be using the disk, so I'll leave it
alone for now so it can go to sleep.
