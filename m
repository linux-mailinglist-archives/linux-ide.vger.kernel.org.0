I am well aware of this policy and always work hard to not introduce any
regression or to address them with the highest priority when they happen. It is
however very unfortunate that such policy must be followed even when the
regression is due to some bad hardware that does not correctly follow
specifications and just happen to "work" by chance before a change. I do not
feel that is right, especially considering that in this case, the revert will
cause users with correct hardware to again see very long boot time (minutes order).

Sure, but then avoiding the long boot time will still need a module parameter to
force applying a port mask. So it is one or the other here... I vote to support
well good hardware.

Anyway, I am not going to fight this and go with the revert for now. But if we
do not get anything from ASMedia to help resolve this, these broken adapters are
likely to cause issues again in the future. And because of that, I would very
much like to just blacklist them unless someone write a special driver for these
that does not pretend to be AHCI compliant. Because they are not.
