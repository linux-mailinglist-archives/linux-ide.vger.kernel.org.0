Yes, but only for drives that report full identify data when PUIS is enabled.
For drives that report incomplete identify data, we have no choice but to wake
them up. And yes, we need integration with runtime pm to set the initial power
state of the drive to standby (instead of "on") for both the ata device and its
scsi device.

I need to check that. I think there may be a better/easier way to get the
current power state of a drive. Will get back to you on that.
