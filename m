I was not commenting about what to do about your problem, but about the fact
that your sentence was very hard to understand because it was not technically
accurate.

I never proposed to change that in any way. That is fine and can stay as it is.
What I do NOT want to do is expand upon this to try to solve issues. The reason
for that, which I already stated, is that hdparm issue passthrough commands. And
if the user wants to use passthrough commands, then most of the time, he/she
will have to deal with the consequences of not using kernel-provided management
methods.

I did propose to allow for runtime suspend to to use sleep state instead of
standby. That would be fairly easy to do and replace manual "hdparm -Y" with a
well integrated control of the disk power state up to the block layer.
You never commented back about this.

What is this legacy standby timer ? What control path does it trigger ? Do
udisks2/gnome-disk-utility use that timer to issue commands like "hdparm -Y"  ?
Or does that timer tigh into the regular runtime suspend ?

No. As said many times now, I am not going to do anything about the hdparm -Y
hacking. If a user want better power management features, he/she should enable
power management in their kernels.

No. The scsi layer issues a FLUSH CACHE whenever a disk is removed, goes to
sleep or the system shutdown. And there is no need to do that if the disk is
already in standby. If you see that happening, then we need to fix that.

If the device is in sleep state from "hdparm -Y", then only libata knows that
the device is sleeping with the ATA_DFLAG_SLEEPING flag. That is the fundamental
problem here: pm-core, scsi and the block layer do not know that the block
device is sleeping (and so already had its write cache flushed). Your patches
are not solving this root cause issue. They are only hidding it by faking the
commands. This is a hack, wich likely will need more hacks in the future for
different cases. See my point ? I do not want to go down such route. Let's fix
things properly.

Not that simple. See above.
