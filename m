It is and that probably is the reason why disabling hotplug does nothing on the
port external characteristic. Does this machine really have eSata ports ? Do
they correspond to the 4 ports (out of 8) that you see as external
(link_power_management_supported = 0 ports) ?

Likely, you have the SXS host capability set for this machine because of this
BIOS setup. From the AHCI specifications:

Supports External SATA (SXS): When set to ‘1’, indicates that the HBA has one or
more Serial ATA ports that has a signal only connector that is externally
accessible (e.g. eSATA connector).

Hotplug is reported as a separate bit, but handled in the same way as an
external port as we cannot (easily) support LPM if we want to preserve the
hotplug capability (LPM changes the PHY state constantly, which clashes with hot
plug/unplug PHY changes and is hard to differentiate).

Note that you can see if a port is external in dmesg. Look for:

ata4: SATA max UDMA/133 abar m524288@0xaa500000 port 0xaa500280 irq 112 lpm-pol
1 ext

A regular port will not have the "ext" at the end:

ata5: SATA max UDMA/133 abar m524288@0xaa500000 port 0xaa500300 irq 112 lpm-pol 1
