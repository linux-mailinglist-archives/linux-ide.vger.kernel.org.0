See ata_dev_revalidate() and ata_dev_configure() and all the drive features that
are checked using the identify data. We need to preserve that to ensure that
nothing changed on the drive so that its representation in libata is kept in
sync with the drive config. That is why drive starting with PUIS and not giving
full identify data *must* be woken up, which is the current libata behavior.

You do not need to change the hierarchy of devices. An ata_dev is already a
child of its scsi_dev. So if you want to set the ata device to runtime suspend
state, you have to have the parent in the same state too. runtime suspend work
top-to-bottom in the device chain. You cannot have random device in the middle
of the chain going to suspend without the devices above it also being suspended.

Also, the user does not use ata devices directly. They use the scsi device
representing the ata device. You must thus have that in sync with the ata device
state.

TEST UNIT READY is the command to use. I need to check the specs again about how
it reports the device state though. I think it is through sense data. The scsi
disk driver issues that command already to check that the drive is spun-up. See
sd_revalidate_disk() calling sd_spinup_disk(). So that will also need to change
to be aware of the initial power state to not spinup the drive if not wanted.
That will need to be done extremely carefully though to only affect ata devices
with PUIS. Likely some additional scsi device flag will be needed for this. I
have not looked into that yet.
