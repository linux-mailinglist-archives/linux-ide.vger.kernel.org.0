Ah, the joy of PMP :)
There are 2 types of PMP:
1) Command based switching: one port can be used to connect up to 15 drives, but
all drives cannot be used at the same time, similarly to PATA. One command is
sent to one drive and another command will not be issued to another drive until
the previous commands complete. So no NCQ with this.
2) FIS based switching: up to 15 drives can be connected to the physical port
and the devices can be used simultaneously, including with NCQ.

Depending on this, management in libata/libahci/ahci differs. See
ata_port->pmp_links[] array being used, despite the fact that we have
ata_port->link per port. This is all not trivial and not being the author of
this old support code, I often get confused with this myself. I have both types
of PMP in the lab, but I never really dug too much into it since eSATA is old
technology that no-one sells anything anymore. So this is all in "maintenance"
mode. Nothing new will ever be implemented for PMP, only bug fixes. All the
eSata boxes I have actually crash/do not work at all if I plug very recent
drives into them...

Your PMP is looking like type (1).

How can you enable runtime PM on a port ? That does not work...

They are the first 2 devices connected to the PMP port that exist. These
correspond to your sdd and sde scsi disks.

If there is no PM op defined for a device (link in this case), PM core assumes
nothing needs to be done and sets the device pm state directly. At least, that
is my understanding. Would need to check again the pm code to be 100% sure.

The other thing here is that we have scsi_disk -> scsi_device -> ata_port
ancestry relationship. For the ata device and link, we have:

ata_device -> ata_link -> ata_port

So scsi_device and ata_device/link do not have any parent-child relation,
leading to the PM core code to not introduce and dependencies for their power state.

Are you running the latest code from Linus tree ? There is now a check on the
power state of a device to avoid useless activate.

I think I may have one of these in the lab. I am currently using a ASMedia
ASM1062 controller which shows the PMP drives exactly like your setup. On
another machine, I have a more intelligent Marvell PMP adapter which has FBS
support.

Please switch to using Linus latest tree (libata for-6.7 branch) as that has
some additional changes around suspend/resume.
