Indeed.

This likely was added to force the drive to spinup, to avoid subsequent commands
to fail. The start process doing a port reset and then revalidating the drive,
which starts by issuing an IDENTIFY command, definitely will wake up the drive.
There is no need for relying on scsi to do it.

However, I am still not convinced that the revalidate should be done at all,
unless the scsi layer does do it too. As you said, this may be causing
unwarranted spinup for cases when the drive is not used after resuming. But
again here, scsi and ATA revalidate are not linked either. One does not trigger
the other.

Hannes suggested doing all ATA start/stop processing solely relying on libata,
that is, not using manage_start_stop at all. This is another option I am
considering.

Yes it is. I have seen issues with the shutdown side, most of the time showing
as a synchronize cache failure. But until now, I had no clear understanding
how/why that happened. I understand it now and will be fixing that.

I will revisit everything around PM operations. ATA is indeed legacy-ish for
most desktop/laptop users as NVMe has taken over most systems. But there are
still a lot of enterprise deployments using ATA drives, and a lot of users
running old hardware. The former is rather easy to deal with as the hardware is
most of the time very recent, and so better than old devices. The former is a
constant source of headaches due to the sheer amount of buggy hardware out
there. The potential for regressions when changing something is high, so I try
to be prudent with changes.

Thank you for your comments.
