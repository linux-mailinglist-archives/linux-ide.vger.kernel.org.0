No since you do not seem to be using dmcrypt/raid/lvm that should
do the trick.

Except that it sounds like this is a partition carrying vm
images. Those never delete storage, they only grow, to
effectively trim you need to either punch holes in files,
or remove files. Discard only comes in to play when used
diskspace becomes unused.

To test preferably remove several large files at once while
also generating a whole bunch of other diskio (e.g.
compile the kernel while also deleting several large files
from the same disk, with discard enable).

But even if that works for you, that is 1 report that this
works in some cases, vs many that it does not work; and also
note that you had to manually enable this, it was not
enabled before. So this really is going to impact the
performance of very few users, while looking at the amount
of bugreports about hangs / disk-corruption the problem
of having queued-trim support enabled is much much bigger,
so I see very little reason to re-enable this even if it
happens to work in your case.

> Or is there a way to check that discard is effectively enabled?

There probably is, but I don't know where / how to check this.

Hans
