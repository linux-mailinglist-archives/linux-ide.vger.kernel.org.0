I thought about it but ruled it out so that we do not overload EH with handling
of non-NCQ commands. libata EH is already complicated enough :)

You are kind of proving my point here: I feel that is all much more complicated
than using the libata internal deferred qc work. Also, involving the SCSI layer
about non-NCQ commands deferral is kind of a layering violation as the
non-queueable command concept does not exist in SCSI.

Sure, we could make that working, but as mentioned above, I feel that is a lot
more complicated.

libata must act as a SATL and the SAT specifications are clear about what a SATL
implementation can do for non-NCQ commands. Referring to SATA6r01:

6.2.5 Commands the SATL queues internally
If the translation of a SCSI command requires the SATL to send an ATA non-NCQ
command to the ATA device while one or more ATA commands are active, then the
SATL shall:
a) suspend processing of that SCSI command, and:
	1) maintain the SCSI command in a task set;
	2) resume processing of that SCSI command when the ATA device returns command
complete for all ATA commands the SATL has previously sent to the ATA device; and
	3) after that SCSI command completes, resume processing of other SCSI commands;
b) return TASK SET FULL status for that SCSI command; or
c) return BUSY status for that SCSI command.

What you are proposing does not nicely fit. This patch essentially implements
option (a). Option (c) is the current code, which causes the issue for
multi-queue cases (note that AHCI is not affected because it is single queue).
And option (c) would be mostly equivalent to (b) and cause the same issue as
that would involve a requeue too.
