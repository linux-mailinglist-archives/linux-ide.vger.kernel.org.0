>>> I forgot to mention the main benefit: Without the "downgrade-jumper" the drives are able to run at SATA-2 speed (the 88SE6121 is a SATA-2 controller). At least with kernel 2.6.x (ahci module) one can see the ST3500418AS running at 3Gbps:

That is very odd. sata_lpm_ignore_phy_events() is only a couple of "if"
statements and there are no register accesses in there. So if the few CPU cycles
that takes make a difference, I would suspect that there is something odd going
on with the marvell adapter interrupts.

So commenting out that "if (sata_lpm_ignore_phy_events)" hunk is not enough to
fix your issue then. This hunk may not be directly related to the issue and
commenting it out simply changes the timing making things better.

But above, you said that things are not completely stable with 6.x. So there is
likely something else going on.

First things first: can you please test with the latest mainline 6.10-rc6 kernel
and send a dmesg output after boot and any other relevant output showing
problems when doing IOs ?
