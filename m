Yes, I know what I need to check. I meant, that you write without this 
patchset my system with HBA controller X and 32 [vendor/model] disks 
attached reaches the message Y in Z1 seconds, and with the series Z2 
seconds.

Sounds good. But this needs to be available before the changes at hand, 
doesn’t it?

Yes, I was only talking about on/off. (You probably thought, I was 
referring to the mechanism I tried to implement in my RFC series.)


Kind regards,
