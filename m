Yes. I rechecked the specs regarding this and there is nothing preventing
IDENTIFY from completing with the drive spun down. The only corner case is when
PUIS is enabled, in which case IDENTIFY may return incomplete data. But that is
handled already and that is not something we can get with a system
suspend/resume or runtime suspend/resume.

From re-reading the specs and testing with all my drives, the port reset spins
up the drives and IDENTIFY completes OK before the spinup completes, so there
is no delay. I CC-ed you a couple of patches that move the VERIFY command
issuin to after revalidation (so execution of IDENTIFY, READ LOG etc). That
works well. I also added a CHECK POWER MODE command to check if sending the
verify is actually needed. And even while the disks are spinning up, I get
power mode 0xFF indicating ACTIVE state, so no need to send the VERIFY command
at all. The end result is that we get to finish the libata EH context doing the
resume well before the disk finishes spinning up (which can take 10+ seconds).

With this, the first read or write command following the resume will be delayed
until the drive finishes spinning up. But that is fine given the default 30s
tiemout and retries. I do not expect any problems with that.
