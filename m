Hello Damien,

Sorry for the late reply, I have been busy porting an ancient android
kernel to GCC 10 and have consumed lots of time on that.

Most drives support HPA but it was not enabled on my device. Kernel
could boot without HPA but I would not recommend it. I have seen x86
firmware using it to backup its image in HPA area so we could get into
big trouble.

I am sure that this is not an HDD issue but can verify that HPA is
workable on another host. Will test an AMD one and test a boot with
the proposed argument. I planned to test it with an LBA28 disk but
haven't done so as I need a spare one. Will definitelly do it during
the weekend.

Thank you!
