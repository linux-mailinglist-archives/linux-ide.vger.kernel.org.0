Fixed, somehow I thought I had followed the surrounding style, I was
wrong.

Done, though long-term the commit message might be harder to find than
the comment...

Not sure I understand the question right.
The patch is a best-guess + "in doubt disable" attempt at
auto-detecting.
As I mentioned the data is rather light, so I wanted to only add the
option at first.
Now it does 2 things in addition:
- disable it for Crucial MX500 because the issue was seen and confirmed
  with and without PATA converter with that device
- disable it for anything connected with a PATA converter because there
  are lots of bug reports with different devices that have a PATA
  converter in common. Unfortunately no confirmation from any of those.
  However in quick testing I could verify the MX500 issue only with
  PATA adapter myself, so it seems like an appropriate precaution,
  especially as now with the new code it is possible to override both
  ways.

(should I put something more in the commit message? I didn't want to
bloat it too much)

Aside: I don't have the ATA spec, so I can't check, but I do find it
a bit suspicious that the logs look like the code runs the
READ_LOG_DMA command before SETXFERMODE is done, and thus while the
device is still in PIO mode?

I missed the right place to do that before, I think I now found it, so
moved.

Thanks for the review,
