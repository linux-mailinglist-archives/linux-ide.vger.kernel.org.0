I mostly agree. However, extending the timeout did not help in the past.
I found that even setting it to 240 was not enough.
If there is no response in 30s then none is coming. I never saw a pause longer than 30s that came back later.
The pause is either up to 30s or unlimited (until timeout is reached and a reset).

ATM I have the setting of timeout=120 in rc.local.

I also have in my boot cmd:
	libata.force=2.00:noncq
This is because with ncq, if a pause reaches a timeout then the disk records a Command_Timeout.
In the smart log it is now up to 34360262682 (8,8,26) but stable since ncq was disabled (at 1/Nov)
despite many timeout resets since.

I suspect a fw bug or a design fault(*), but just for fun I will run with max_sectors_kb=4096 and timeout=1024.

BTW, for the last few days I am running with max_sectors_kb=3584 and saw no pauses at all.
with 4096 and 4095 I did get a long pause/reset.

	Eyal

(*) smart shows 180TB written so far in 1.6y on. I see a workload limit of 180TB/y listed but
I also saw an older spec that said 55TB/y. I do not know if I have a v1, v2 or v3 of this model.
