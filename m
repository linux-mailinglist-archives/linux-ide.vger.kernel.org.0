Reading more about scsi_add_single_device(), the comment says "Note: this seems
to be aimed exclusively at SCSI parallel busses.". So I don't think we should
worry about it. But then I also do not understand why libata is wired to this at
all. Cannot have ATA device on a parallel SCSI bus...

On my system, I cannot get

echo "scsi add-single-device X 0 100 0" >/proc/scsi/scsi

to do anything and so I do not see how ata_scsi_user_scan can ever be called...
