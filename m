I now understand this, the error does not originate from the disk itself which may be unaware of it.

Initially, after a series of failures ncq was internally disabled
	ata2.00: NCQ disabled due to excessive errors
after which I forced it off, in the boot command
	ata2.00: FORCE: modified (noncq)
and no Command_Timeout was counted since.

after which I set command

This is an older SMA disk, and I will not be surprised if the disk was not even executing the command yet
but was doing some housekeeping when it was reset. After raising the timeout 30s to 180s I still had one
case where a reset was invoked. I see (iostat was running) that there was no activity on the disk that whole time.

Or maybe it is just a fw bug in the disk (ST8000AS0002-1NA17Z from 2016)?
Is it possible that a reset when a command is pending is not counted in the smart log?

Interestingly, after repeated consecutive resets the link speed was downshifted 6.0->3.0->1.5g.
Now it boots at 3.0g when it used to always boot at 6.0g.
There must be a real issue there which is why the disk will be replaced anyway.

Regardless, I now have a better understanding of the i/o path.

	Eyal
