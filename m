Not supported.

Is there a way to mark everything unused? Or was SMR not designed to handle this, way back in 2014?
I am able to copy the disk elsewhere, clear?, then copy back.

Seagate shows the disk (ST8000AS0002-1NA17Z) as released in 2014. Says "No Newer Firmware Available".
Latest fw I found mentioned are AR15/AR17 (mine is AR13) which still do not support trim. It is for a later disk revision.
