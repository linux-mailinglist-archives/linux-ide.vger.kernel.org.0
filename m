Now you got me confused.
What exactly would be the semantics of a READ request with the FUA bit 
set? Ignore the cache and read from disk?
That would only make sense if the cache went out of sync with the drive, 
which really shouldn't happen, no?

Hmm. Is this a requirement? We _could_ use the NCQ variants even with a 
queue depth of 1, no?

Sure, that would be the way I would be going.
If the drive supports NCQ we should always be using the FPDMA variants, 
irrespective of the queue depth.
Additionally we _might_ make FUA dependent on NCQ, and disallow FUA for 
non-NCQ drives.
(Where it's questionable anyway; if you only have a single command 
outstanding the pressure on any internal cache is far less as with NCQ.)

Cheers,

Hannes
