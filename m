The machine is: Gigabyte Z390 UD, BIOS AMI F8

The disk is, according to smartctl:
	Model Family:     Seagate Archive HDD (SMR)
	Device Model:     ST8000AS0002-1NA17Z
	Firmware Version: AR13
	User Capacity:    8,001,563,222,016 bytes [8.00 TB]
	Sector Sizes:     512 bytes logical, 4096 bytes physical
There was no hw change during this period.

Here is what I think:

This disk did not exhibit the problem for the last 1.5 years when it was in constant use.
	[before that, since Jan/2016, it was used every few months as a backup disk]
Then, last month it started to show the problem.

Being an early SMR disk, is it possible that it reached a state where all block updates require a track read/write
(no more unused tracks) and at high bandwidth it gets into trouble. It did not matter how high I set the timeout
(I tested up to 240) it always timed out if any pause was encountered.

Being a rather old disk (a 2014 model?)
	Maybe a fw bug?
	Maybe an SMR design misfeature?

Do you want me to try different max_sectors_kb values to see where it breaks?

	Eyal
