Flush issuing is a lot more complicated than just blkdev_issue_flush(). There is
a whole file dedicated to handling flushes (block/blk-flush.c).

But that is beside the point, which is that trying to not execute flush is
simply completely wrong. Please stop trying.

For your case, which is a drive put to sleep with hdparm -Y, only libata is
aware that the drive is sleeping. That first needs to change if you want the
kernel overall to be able to do anything. As I proposed already, using runtime
PM with sleep mode instead of standby would be a good start.

Regarding the flushes and other commands you see that are waking up the drive
for no *apparent* good reasons, please identify what application/component is
issuing these commands and look there to see why the commands are being issued
and if that is done with awareness for the device power state.

Then we can patch properly instead of trying to "hack".
