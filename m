My bad on this one. The model string is absolutely correct. However, this drive
is not known to have any LPM related issues and that is something that is tested
during the drive development and known to the manufacturer to be working. So the
issue could be due to the AHCI adapter, or the adapter not liking this drive for
some reason...

This information will still be useful to check which FW revision you are running
on the drive. This particular model is EOL so there are no more FW updates, but
we should at least check that you are running the latest rev.

Could you also share a dmesg output showing the adapter probe and drive scan on
boot as well as any error message that may be happening ? That will tell us the
adapter you are using as well.

And if you could test the same adapter with another drive to see if LPM works,
that would be great. Thanks !
