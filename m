Hello My Dear.

Please do not feel disturbed for contacting  you, based on the
critical condition I find mine self, though, it's not financial
problem, but my health, you might have know that cancer is not what to
talk home about, I am married to Mr. Abaulkarim Rail who worked with
Tunisia embassy in Ghana for nine years before he died in the year
2012.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a
brief illness that lasted for five days.


Since his death I decided not to remarry, When my late husband was
alive he deposited the sum of US$ 10.5m (Ten million Five hundred
thousand dollars) in a bank in Ghana, Presently this money is still in
bank. And My Doctor told me that I don't have much time to live
because of the cancer problem, Having known my condition I decided to
hand you over this fund to take care of the less-privileged people,
you will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I
want you to take 30 Percent of the total money for your personal use
While 70% of the money will go to charity" people and helping the
orphanage and the poor.

i will really do appreciate  if l can put  my trust on you to help me
claim my fund for the mission  of the Lord in donating it to the
Motherless Baby Home (ORPHANAGE). I want you to know that am right
here lying on the sick bed at the hospital waiting for the Lord's call
but i really want this mission to be well accomplished by the God sent
Angel who will be doing this on my behalf which is you, So there are
some information=E2=80=99s you need to forward to the bank, because when th=
e
fund was deposited by my late husband the bank gave him this secret
information should in case he want to withdraw it for security purpose
for them to identify his consignment which is the fund.


I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by the Government. I grew
up as an Orphan and I don't have anybody as my family member,

I am expecting your urgent respond.
Here is my private email address ( misslindarail@gmail.com)

Regards,
Mrs.Linda Rail
written from Hospital.
