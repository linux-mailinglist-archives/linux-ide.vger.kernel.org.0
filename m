   Agreed.

   Hm... we can't, as ata_std_prereset() sometimes directly implement prereset()
and pmp_prereset() methods and those should return *int*...

   I think you've missed 'ata_base_port_ops' also using ata_std_prereset()...

   There are no drivers using it as a method -- only libata-sff.c does it,
others have a wrapper around it.

   I think I'd like to keep my approach...
