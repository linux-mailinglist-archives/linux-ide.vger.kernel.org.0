Except for bit 0x20 (device fault), the other bits do not match anything
sensible either. So I wonder what specs this is against. Hannes ? 7-years=
 old
patch... I am sure your memory is very fresh about this one :)

Yes, with a SAS HBA that has SAT implemented in FW, the HBA FW will do th=
e
conversion to sense data for failed commands. No way of knowing how that =
is done
there.

Yes, that type of error generally means something goes badly during scann=
ing or
revalidate, e.g. access to a log page failing. That is a fairly common pr=
oblems
on many drives (e.g. drives advertising support for READ LOG DMA EXT but =
that
command in fact not working). Your drive may need some quirks to get a re=
liable
scan.

Have you checked if your drive already has some entry in ata_device_black=
list
(in libata-core.c) ?
