Yes, that would be nice to have, but... see below.

It would be better, but:
1) When setting hotplug_enable to false, we need to set NO_LPM for the port and
change the target policy to max-performance. Not too hard to do, but then...
2) When setting hotplug_enable to true, we need to clear NO_LPM for the port
and set the target policy to the default. However, we actually have no idea
what set NO_LPM. It may be that the device/adapter/port actually do not support
LPM, so in that case, we should not clear it.

So because of (2), unless we cleanup the mess of port/device flags to have
different flags to differentiate between "HW supports X" and "X is
enabled/disabled", I do not think we can do the sysfs trick easily.
