That is normal if either the device connected to this host or the adapter itself
is identified as not supporting LPM.

Again, normal in the context described above.

Which was a horrible bug: the ata subsystem was identifying the device or
adapter as not supporting LPM, but the sysfs knob was left open for chnages, and
systemd would happily set whatever power management policy it wanted, even if
the device or adapter did not support it. So this "worked correctly" is actually
"that was a really nasty bug".

The problem here is to understand why you adapter/device is identified as not
supporting LPM, even though it seems to do support it.

Yes, all normal if LPM is disabled and you are stuck with max performance policy.

Please send everything that scsi/ahci/ata prints. That is not nearly enough to
understand what is going on here.

Looking at the ahci driver, I do not see any special quirks for PCI ID
8086:4d03. So we need all the messages from the latest kernel to understand this.

There is no quirk applied to the adapter PCI ID 8086:4d03 that I can see. So it
will be initialized with board_ahci, meaning that LPM will be allowed, but only
if we detect that the adapter report that as supported. If the adapter does not
have the right bits set reporting LPM support, especially DIPM/HIPM, then LPM
will be disabled. Please send the full dmesg so that we can check.
