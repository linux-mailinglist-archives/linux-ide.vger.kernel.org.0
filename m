Personally, I think my suggestion is much less complicated, as we do not need
to think about when to clear ap->deferred_qc or when to stop the workqueue,
during the special cases like when a reset occurs, or when a NCQ command fails.
I'm a little bit worried that there are some other special cases that we might
be overlooking.

Reusing the method we already use for CDL commands would completely sidestep
these issues, as we are putting the command in the SCSI EH workqueue, which
will requeue the command for us.

I do not see it as a layering violation, as we simply wait for the queue to
drain, then let SCSI EH retry/insert the failed/deferred non-NCQ command in
the normal SCSI queue.

The non-NCQ should be the only command that is failed, but even if there was
a NCQ command that failed as well, we will retry scmd->allowed times anyway,
so the non-NCQ command should eventually be the only command that is retried.

I think my suggestion would be a)
since by triggering EH, we wait for all commands to complete,
then resume processing of the non-NCQ command.

That said, I know that you had plans to change the processing of CDL commands
to use a workqueue instead of EH, so in the grand scheme of things, if we will
migrate to use a workqueue instead of EH for CDL, perhaps it makes sense if we
also use a workqueue for a deferred non-NCQ command.

Will we be able to use the same workqueue, or will we soon have two different
workqueues?


Kind regards,
Niklas
