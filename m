Yea, they aren't ready to merge yet, so I didn't add the tag.  I suppose
I could have put RFC in the subject.

Yes; I sent the second version as a reply to the first.  Isn't that the

That's a few replies down from [PATCH 0/1].  There was some discussion
first, then I sent that patch series as a reply to that discussion.
