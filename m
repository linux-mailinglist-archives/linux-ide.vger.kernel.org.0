Unfortunately, this has been the case for this machine since it became
available. I can happily boot any kernel on other systems of the same
vintage without touching anything firmware related, which is crucial
to identify regressions.

The A8k requires instead a per-kernel DT, something that only works if
you treat it as an embedded system, and not a standard system (which
is why mine has been collecting dust for some time now). I don't think
the maintainers have ever been interested in solving this problem.

As for ACPI, that'd probably be the best thing that can happen to this
platform. Not sure that's remotely possible though, given how
"interesting" the HW is.
