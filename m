Correct - the PCMCIA device drivers use IO port addresses in the ISA 
port range.

There's the APNE driver (Amiga PCMCIA NE2000 clone), which is already 
catered for by the current code in io_mm.h. I remember seeing patches 
for that driver that would allow support of a variant of the APNE card 
that were hard to integrate in the current NE clone code framework. 
Didn't consider adding another isa_type for that card at the time - I'll 
revisit these patches if I can find them again.

Supporting PB190 PCMCIA hardware requires adding a new isa_type and the 
corresponding IO translation cases. Not much more, for all I can see. 
Existing chipset drivers from other architectures ought to work already. 
Maybe add a specific block_input() hook as for APNE (but I surmise that 
might just be code duplication from generic code in lib8390.c - didn't 
check).

Not sure what card socket code the APNE driver uses - must be one of the 
generic variants from drivers/pcmcia. If your PB190 needs something not 
already in there, we'd need to add that as well.

> Is PCMCIA support something we should also consider in all of this?

Absolutely.
