Optional in the sense that it isn't essential in achieving the main function
of the device, which means that most don't end up using it.

A lot of historical devices too which don't get much scrutiny or testing but
can still cause significant griefs for the users.

On a quick glance, there are some uses of REQ_FUA w/o REQ_PREFLUSH which
indicates that there can be actual gains to be had. However, ext4 AFAICS
always pairs PREFLUSH w/ FUA, so a lot of use cases won't see any gain while
taking on the possible risk of being exposed to FUA commands.

The PC thing to say now seems to be allowlist / blocklist instead of
whiltelist / blacklist, not that I mind either way.

So, AFAIK, windows doesn't issue FUA for SATA devices, only SAS, but I could
be wrong. It'd be really useful to find out.

The context here is that we promptly found all of these devices struggle
with FUA (like locking up and dropping off the bus) shortly after we enabled
FUA by default, so the list is by no means exhaustive and is more an
indication that there at least were a whole lot of devices which choke on
FUA. On top, devices not sold anymore are even harder to debug and pay
attention to while being able to cause a lot of pain to configurations which
have been stable and happy for a long time.

NCQ is really old now and our previous attempt at FUA was after NCQ was
widely available, so I'm not sure this holds.

This sort of problems especially if affecting mostly old devices can be very
difficult to suss out and will definitely take way longer than a single
release cycle.

Yeah, that'd help and also if SAS HBA SAT's have been issuing FUA's which
would be a meaningful verification of the feature, at least for rotating
hard disks.

I feel rather uneasy about enabling FUA by default given history. We can
improve its chances by restricting it to newer devices and maybe even just
hard disks, but it kinda comes back to the root question of why. Why would
we want to do this? What are the benefits? Right now, there are a bunch of
really tricky cons and not whole lot on the pro column.

Thanks.
