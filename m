Sure, looking at the thread it looks more of a communication issue. I
am also surprised the breakage went unnoticed for a while (unless
everyone is using edk2, like myself :) ). I think it would be good to
revert the change on top of v5.11.x. The drivers adoption would have to
land before v5.12 though, so that not to repeat the problem during next rel=
ease.

Small rant:
A general issue with the DT binding changes of this kind (previously
clocks, ICU, etc.) that I have, is a side effect of incompatibility
with older kernels/other OSs. The latter must follow the
modifications, but you can forget of booting e.g. Debian Buster with
the ToT device tree. Therefore in edk2 I do not update the device tree
fork to often and need to tweak it in order to have the widest support
coverage.

I'm dropping this note, so that in similar case in future, there is additio=
nal
consideration, how the change impacts a wider ecosystem, not only
today's Linux top of tree.

Thanks,
Marcin
