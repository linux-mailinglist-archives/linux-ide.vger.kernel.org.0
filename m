First of all: Thank you to anyone looking into this. From the initial
responses I felt like "Well, bad card - go get some proper stuff".
Second: Sorry for the late reply, for some reason gmail not notified
me about the new mails.

I will try the provided patch to see if this makes any difference
about how the card behaves.

Here're the output from sudo lspci -vvv -nn

The card I use is one like these: https://www.ebay.com/itm/204230341609
When you search for "20 port sata" you will quite a list of such cards
- there're even ones with more than 20 ports, like this massive 24
port card: https://www.ebay.com/itm/394640351214
The subsystem IDs don't lead to anywhere - from a quick google search
it seems they use it on any of the cards no matter if it's a ASM1064
or ASM1166. So, using it as a filter likely doesn't cut it for
something like auto-detection. A manual override is likely the best
way to go - however it ends up implemented.

I'm not sure exactly - but here's as how I understand it: Some (likely
chinese) oem just get some ASMedia chips as base controllers along
with some sata port multiplier like the JMicron JMB575 and create such
abominations as the cards linked. From what I can tell: Each chip has
its own eeprom flash and they're just directly connected: One JMB575
multiplier at each of the ASM1064 upstream ports.
btw: the JMB575 is a 1-to-5 multiplier.
When I first used that card I already noted that it lists 24 ports -
but I thought that this could be some kind of "masking" the 4 upstream
ports as they get faned out by the multipliers. This is also the
behaviour on Windows: It shows 24 ports in sequence with 4 of them
somewhere in the middle just unuseable. According to windows this card
is even supposed to support hot plug - although I haven't tested that
yet.
It also supports power-up-in-standby of the my drives, although that
massively increases my boot time from about 30 seconds when all drives
start up on power up (my PSU can handle it - although I plan on expand
my pool hence I have such a HBA) to about 2 minutes when each drive is
spun up one at a time.

As these cards are so common and in such wide varieties my guss is
that there's some generic firmware which was written once and in a way
to work on all of these cards - and hence just reports up to 32 ports.
It could be that it was done in a way "to just work with the least
amount of effort" and hence can cause side effects.

I still hassle with the initial report: I couldn't tell any time lost
or gained. For me the probe of an unused port only takes roughly 0.3
seconds. Even multiplying by 128 I only get about 40 seconds. How
would someone end up with 3-4 minutes? On the other hand: When a drive
is connected and has to be initialized this does take more time - for
me roughly 1 second per drive. But even then a jbod with 128 drives
would take only 2 minutes or so. Is there something I just don't get
because I don't know or don't understand properly?

Anyway, have a nice weekend.
I'll report back when I tested the patch.

Greetings from Germany

Matt
