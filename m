I'm not sure how the command_timeout counter in the smart log works.

But from the Linux driver perspective, if an I/O has not completed within the
timeout, we will reset the controller, and retry the outstanding commands.

This timeout is defined by Linux, and is by default 30 seconds, like you
mentioned.

Not sure how the drive FW counts a command_timeout, but it is possible that
this internal counter has a timeout that is different from 30 seconds.

For AHCI, performing a hardreset is done by writing a register, so it is not
actually a command that is sent down to the drive. (For a softreset on the
other hand, a command is actually sent down to the drive.)


Kind regards,
Niklas
