Non of those code paths are called for this device, probably due to some
other flag disqualifying them.

That was my first thought but then I found ATA_HORKAGE_NO_ID_DEV_LOG
which was in the calling path that actually triggered this issue.

But, yes, I totally agree that's a more solid solution preventing this
kind of issue to crop up again.

I'd think it's fitting to send it to linux-stable, because it prevents
those DOM's from working in v5.15.5+.

Ok. I must have missed that part when I read submitting-patches doc.

I'll rework and re-submit the patch.
