I was just checking *ata_port, and based my judgement on that one.

yeah, I think it should be fine, as the compiler should treat 
ata_port_is_frozen() as self-contained and thus make no judgement 
optimizing out such reads when inlining.

I'm still not inclined to add const specifier, but I'll leave that to 
Damien and you.

I think generally we could add const a lot more in the kernel codebase. 
But we don't, as if we need to change how we treat the data we point to, 
i.e. stop writing or start writing, then we need to start changing APIs, 
and that is not so welcome, and so generally omit it. The same goes for 
non-ptr functions args. And then programmers are often a bit lazy and 
over-confident too (to not bother using it) :).

Thanks,
John
