Yes, that is why I want to push the patches early in the cycle to be able
to revert if too many problems are reported.

The conflict is not hard to resolve. The point is that my patches changin=
g
the default to no debounce delay completely remove the changes of your
patch to do the same for one or some adapters. So adding your patches now
and then my patches on top does not make much sense at all.

If too many problems show up and I end up reverting/removing the patches,
then I will be happy to take your patches for the adapter you tested. Not=
e
that *all* the machines I have tested so far are OK without a debounce
delay too. So we could add them too... And endup with a long list of
adapters that use the default ahci driver without debounce delay. The goa=

of changing the default to no delay is to avoid that. So far, the adapter=
s
I have identified that need the delay have their own declaration, so we
only need to add a flag there. Simpler change that listing up adapters
that are OK without the delay.
