I am not entirely sure what you mean with the last sentence above, but for
external ports, LPM cannot be used if you want to keep the port hotplug
capability alive and working. Without keeping such port at max power state, we
cannot detect hotplug events (which is super annoying when you have e.g. a
server with front loading drive bays allowing swapping drives without shutting
the machine down).

Niklas and I actually suspected that we would be getting "complaints" about this
change. Well... We did :)

The problem really is that external ports have never been properly handled by
libata so SATA hot-plugging never really worked reliably. Patches queued up for
6.17 before this patch prevent the kernel from changing the power state of
external port. And this patch was introduced after seeing systemd.udevd setting
external ports power state to min_power or lower states, thus breaking again the
hotplug capability.

The error you are seeing is thus entirely correct and expected.

The question is though: do we want the user to "ignore" hotplug capability and
instead priviledge low power states. I guess we should have such capability.

There is not. But it would be easy to add a sysfs port attribute, e.g.
/sys/class/ata_port/ata1/external which says "0" for regular ports and "1" for
external ports. We could also make this attribute writable in the case of
external port so that doing:

echo 0 > /sys/class/ata_port/ata1/external

forces the kernel to ignore the external nature of the port and allow user
control of the port/device LPM state.

Would that work for your case ?
