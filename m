In the hybernate (suspend to disk) case, yes, but not in the suspend to RAM
case. Anyway, the PUIS incomplete IDENTIFY case is already handled, so there are
no issues.

Depends on the disk implementation. Not all disks put their metadata on media.
So some disks can start replying to commands like IDENTIFY even with the disks
not fully spun up yet. This difference shows up with (sometimes) seeing
"IDENTIFY failed" due to a timeout on resume. I have old drives that are slow to
spinup and show that. But that is handled with the retries with increased
timeouts. I think it would be nice to patch that though, with longer timeout for
IDENTIFY on resume, to avoid these error messages.

I am not following. What problem are you trying to fix ?
