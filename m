Correct, which is why the performance isn't good when I try to access
both disks at the same time.

It works on *something*, I'm not not sure whether it is or is not the
port.  /sys/devices/pciblahblah/ata2/power/control can be enabled, and
then the port will be runtime suspended.  I'm not not sure what that is
compared to /sys/devices/pciblahblah/ata2/ata_port/ata2/power/control,
which can't be set to auto, and is also /sys/class/ata_port/ata2.  I'm
not sure why there are two different things that look like an "ata port".

Right, but the PMP itself is not suspended.  I think that causes an
attempt to access the PMP while the root port that connects to the PMP
is suspended, so that access obviously fails.

I hadn't pulled in some time.  Updating now.
