Checking again, the path is not super obvious, but it is there:
ata_devres_release() calls ata_host_put(), which drops the kref on the ata_host
memory and will thus free it when the last ref on the dev is dropped.
ata_host_release() is used for that and this function does free everything,
including the port memory within the ata_host structure.

So in essence, the ata_host and ata_port resources are like devres. I wonder if
actually making them real devres would make the code cleaner and simpler.

I will dig into this more to make sure there is no memory leak. As Sasha pointed
out, it seems that the last ref on the dev is actually never dropped. So there
may be an actual memory leak on error but it was there already.
