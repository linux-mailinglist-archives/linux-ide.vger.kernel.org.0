It seems like the block layer is indeed capable of doing a {pre,post}-flush
on reads - neither op_is_flush() nor blk_flush_policy() or
blk_insert_flush() have any checks for request direction.

But, as you mentioned, no higher level kernel code seems to actually issue
such FUA reads.

As Niklas has mentioned the NCQ will be disabled if there are too many
errors (for buggy implementations), so it should be safe to always make
use of it when it is supported by the drive.

In my opinion, having FUA dependent on NCQ totally makes sense
considering that there are no ATA_CMD_READ_FUA{,_EXT}.

In this case the NCQ disabling code in ata_eh_speed_down() will probably
need to clear the queue FUA flag too.
