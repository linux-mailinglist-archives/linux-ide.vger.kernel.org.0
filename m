Thank you for confirming that this section *is* confusing. I was down
the same rabbit-hole checking "status" in whatever ATA spec I could
get my hands on, and it didn't help. Specifically for "WRITE DMA"
where I usually see the error, it seems that bit 6 has no other
meaning than "transport dependent" which for SATA means (I believe)
"drive ready" as it's always been. But that 0x40 is *not* an
"unaligned write" whatever else it may be. My suspicion is that maybe
it went in by accident since it's also in a "whitespace" commit. On
the other hand, it has an explicit comment. I wasn't going to bother
the original author before, but maybe now I should?

Not really, sadly. For me it happens with SSDs behind a Marvell SATA
controller but it doesn't happen when the same SSD goes behind a
fancier SAS controller. This is what led me into the ATA/SCSI layer as
the possible culprit because on the SAS boxes that layer is not used.
BTW there's another "strange" effect that sometimes seems to lose the
LBA flag on the ATA taskfile struct resulting in an obscure error
message about failed CHS addressing. In that case I suspect an
initialization gone wrong or maybe a race condition somewhere, but
it's been a real pain to track down further. If I ever get a better
handle on how to repro this stuff, I certainly will share.

Cheers,
Peter
