A NCQ error means that the device has aborted processing of all active
commands.
To get the single NCQ command that caused the NCQ error, host software has
to read the NCQ error log, which also takes the device out of error state.

When the device encounters a NCQ error, we receive an error interrupt from
the HBA, and call ata_do_link_abort() to mark all outstanding commands on
the link as ATA_QCFLAG_FAILED (which means that these commands are owned
by libata EH), and then call ata_qc_complete() on them.

ata_qc_complete() will call fill_result_tf() for all commands marked as
ATA_QCFLAG_FAILED.

The taskfile is simply the latest status/error as seen from the device's
perspective. The taskfile will have ATA_ERR set in the status field and
ATA_ABORTED set in the error field.

When we fill the current taskfile values for all outstanding commands,
that means that qc->result_tf will have ATA_ERR set for all commands
owned by libata EH.

When ata_eh_link_autopsy() later analyzes all commands owned by libata EH,
it will call ata_eh_analyze_tf(), which will check if qc->result_tf has
ATA_ERR set, if it does, it will set qc->err_mask (which marks the command
as an error).

When ata_eh_finish() later calls __ata_qc_complete() on all commands owned
by libata EH, it will call qc->complete_fn() (ata_scsi_qc_complete()),
ata_scsi_qc_complete() will call ata_gen_ata_sense() to generate sense
data if qc->err_mask is set.

This means that we will generate sense data for commands that should not
have any sense data set. Having sense data set for the non-failed commands
will cause SCSI to finish these commands instead of retrying them.

While this incorrect behavior has existed for a long time, this first
became a problem once we started reading the correct taskfile register in
commit 4ba09d202657 ("ata: libahci: read correct status and error field
for NCQ commands").

Before this commit, NCQ commands would read the taskfile values received
from the last non-NCQ command completion, which most likely did not have
ATA_ERR set, since the last non-NCQ command was most likely not an error.

Fix this by changing ata_eh_analyze_ncq_error() to mark all non-failed
commands as ATA_QCFLAG_RETRY, and change the loop in ata_eh_link_autopsy()
to skip commands marked as ATA_QCFLAG_RETRY.

While at it, make sure that we clear ATA_ERR and any error bits for all
commands except the actual command that caused the NCQ error, so that no
other libata code will be able to misinterpret these commands as errors.
