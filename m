The kernel has a clear no regressions policy and there is ample documented
cases where needing to set a module option to undo the regression was
considered not acceptable.

So there really is no discussion here. We must not regress and thus the default
behavior must be behavior which works out of the box on the boards with
the PMP chips on them.

Also we really want Linux to "just work" having to set a module option
just to make things work very much goes against that.

Hans
