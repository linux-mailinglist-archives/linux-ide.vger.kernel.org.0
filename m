I tested the series on an AMD machine which has AMD AHCI (FCH SATA Controller
[AHCI mode] (rev 51), PCI IDs: 1022:7901) and also a Marvell 88SE9128 PCIe SATA
adapter (PCI ID 1b4b:9128).

SATA Hotplug for the Marvell adapter works out of the box using 6.8-rc3 but
*does not work* at all for the AMD AHCI (not even link down events are seen
when a drive is pulled from a front loading slot).

Applying the series on top of 6.8-rc3, hotplug with the Marvell adapter
continues to work just fine and the AMD AHCI hotplug also finally works !
When pulling a drive I see link down events and re-plugging the drive I see:

So this seems all good to me. Feel free to add:
