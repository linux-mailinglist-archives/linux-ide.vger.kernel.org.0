I did some more digging into this. And I do not think there are any
issues (I tested and it works). The reason is that the "shost" passed to
ata_scsi_user_scan() corresponds to the scsi host for the ata_port of
the ata_device in libsas (dev->sata_dev.ap). It is not the scsi_host
representing the HBA itself (which has multiple devices).

So changing the devno to 0 has no effect and deleting+rescanning
particular devices leads to the correct IDs being used. E.g., on my
system, I have 4 drives connected to the pm80xx:

# lsscsi -g
[0:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      WDC  WUH721818AL W232  /dev/sdc   /dev/sg3
[0:0:1:0]    disk    ATA      WDC  WUH721818AL WTW2  /dev/sdb   /dev/sg1
[0:0:2:0]    disk    ATA      WDC  WUH722222AL Wf86  /dev/sdd   /dev/sg2
[0:0:3:0]    zbc     ATA      WDC  WSH722020AL W803  /dev/sda   /dev/sg0

If I remove the first 0 and 2:

# echo 1 > /sys/class/scsi_device/0:0:0:0/device/delete
# echo 1 > /sys/class/scsi_device/0:0:2:0/device/delete
# lsscsi -g
[0:0:1:0]    disk    ATA      WDC  WUH721818AL WTW2  /dev/sdb   /dev/sg1
[0:0:3:0]    zbc     ATA      WDC  WSH722020AL W803  /dev/sda   /dev/sg0

And then manually rescan in reverse order of the removal:

# echo "scsi add-single-device 0 0 2 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
# lsscsi -g
[0:0:1:0]    disk    ATA      WDC  WUH721818AL WTW2  /dev/sdb   /dev/sg1
[0:0:2:0]    disk    ATA      WDC  WUH722222AL Wf86  /dev/sdc   /dev/sg2
[0:0:3:0]    zbc     ATA      WDC  WSH722020AL W803  /dev/sda   /dev/sg0

# echo "scsi add-single-device 0 0 0 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
# lsscsi -g
[0:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      WDC  WUH721818AL W232  /dev/sdd   /dev/sg3
[0:0:1:0]    disk    ATA      WDC  WUH721818AL WTW2  /dev/sdb   /dev/sg1
[0:0:2:0]    disk    ATA      WDC  WUH722222AL Wf86  /dev/sdc   /dev/sg2
[0:0:3:0]    zbc     ATA      WDC  WSH722020AL W803  /dev/sda   /dev/sg0

I get back all devices with the correct IDs.

Note that I tried John's suggestion as well using an ata_for_each_dev()
loop. That does work well for libsas as we do have ata_dev->sdev set to
the scsi device already when scanning, but does not work for AHCI as we
do not. I will keep doing some more tests with v3 (and correct typos and
suggested) but I think this is all good.
