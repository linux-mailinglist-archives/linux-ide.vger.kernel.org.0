For Tiger Lake I think the problems could be related to the chipset or
BIOS.
The "Intel 500 Series Chipset Family Platform Controller Hub (PCH)"
Spec Update https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/635220 
mentions the following update on page 20:
"BIOS should set this bit to 0 as APST is not supported."
So maybe older BIOS version have this bit set to 1, which may cause
issues?

In the error reports regarding Tiger Lake at least two different SSDs
are mentioned:
"Netac SSD 1TB"
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=2087227#p2087227
"SATA 3 drive (Samsung)"
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=2087334#p2087334

Currently, I'm not aware of Samsung drives having issues with LPM, but
of course I could be missing something here. Unfortunately, the posting
above does not state which Samsung drive it is.

With my Elkhart Lake test system, I have tested the following Samsung
drives successfully: 850 PRO, PM893

There are already many SATA controllers marked as
"board_ahci_low_power", including Bay Trail, Apollo Lake, Comet Lake
PCH-U (I have testsystem of these three platforms, LPM is working
without issues here for me).
So I'm not sure whether it is the SATA devices (drives) or chipsets
having issues in the wild.

Where I have seen issues on the other hand are cases, when a SATA
controller is used for different platforms as mentioned here:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ide/msg63375.html

1527f69204fe ("ata: ahci: Add Green Sardine vendor ID as board_ahci_mobile")
has set 0x7901 as board_ahci_mobile.
As this SATA controller is also used in EPYC servers, SATA Hot-Plug is
not working e.g. in Ubuntu by default (because the distro defaults to
LPM policy 3):
https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/AMD_EPYC_Server_with_Ubuntu_-_Enable_SATA_Hot-Swap
Maybe including additional code which helps to distinguish whether it's
a mobile system or server system with hot-swap could help here.

Thank you very much for your ideas and your time.
I will think about them (although I'm not capable of coding such
changes).

I may give further feedback in the upcoming days.
Maybe other developers have input in here, too.

Kind regards,
Werner
