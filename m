Unless I don't understand your proposal, "stick to the normal interrupt
handler" is not possible as I need this register write to happen at
this time, not at any other moment.

However, on the possibility of having a separate interrupt handler, I
may use the new AHCI_HFALG_LEVEL_MSI flag to change the
devm_request_irq call here [1] and use my own at this moment. The
handler will be in libahci.c though.

Would this be a better approach?
