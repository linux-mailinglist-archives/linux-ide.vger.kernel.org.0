Rather than clear ATA_PFLAG_RESUMING, I was thinking of keeping my
previus change to specify ATA_EH_SET_ACTIVE in the request_pm path
rather than by setting it based on ATA_PFLAG_RESUMING, but just adding a
check to see if the VERIFY fails, and if so, set ATA_EH_SET_ACTIVE again.

Right... unless you also apply this patch to make sure that
ATA_EH_SET_ACTIVE isn't turned on again after it is cleared when PuiS is detected.

Ahh, right... I forgot you did add a CHECK POWER MODE first.

Initially I just set the ATA_DFLAG_SLEEPING flag as if the drive had been
put into SLEEP mode, which triggers EH to wake it up when the drive is
accessed.  I have since switched to actually putting the drive to SLEEP
mode when PuiS is detected since it will save a little more power than
leaving it in STANDBY.

I think you can do it even if the IDENTIFY data is incomplete, as long
as a revalidate_and_attach is done eventually, when waking the drive up.

Yea, I was trying to make it work with runtime suspend before, but you
indicated that the current device hierarchy seems to make that
impossible, so I put that aside for now.  Currently runtime pm thinks
the drive is running even though it isn't, but that isn't any different
than when you hdparm -y or hdparm -Y, or hdparm -S and let the drive
decide to auto standby.  Eventually I'll try to get the runtime pm
sorted but I figured I'd try to get the basic concept working first.

Right now I'm using the SLEEP flag to do this, and when the disk is
accessed, it triggers a round of EH that does the revalidate_and_attach
and in the process, issues the SET FEATURES command to wake the drive.

I've already got it working ;)

I think I sent you an earlier version of the patch a few weeks ago.
I'll post my whole series tonight, after I fix the case of retrying the
VERIFY if it fails.
