s/NCQ read or write commands/NCQ commands/

There are other NCQ commands, such as NCQ SEND and NCQ RECEIVE.
E.g. a user could saturate the queue by doing a NCQ encapsulated READ LOG
DMA EXT.

Instead of introducing a workqueue, did you try/consider to do it the same
way that we handle CDL commands that completed without error:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.19-rc3/drivers/ata/libata-core.c#L4971-L4988

I.e., in qc_defer(), if we try to queue a non-NCQ command while there
are NCQ commands active, set ATA_PFLAG_EH_PENDING so that we do not
trigger fast drain (we wait for the active commands to finish),
and then call ata_qc_schedule_eh() on the non-NCQ qc.

Sure, for passthrough commands specifically, SCSI will not want to
retry the command, because scsi_noretry_cmd() will return true:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.19-rc3/drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c#L2227

But this could easily be solved by e.g. modifying scsi_noretry_cmd()
to add an additional "case DID_REQUEUE: return false;"

And also set set_host_byte(scmd, DID_REQUEUE); (probably based on a
new ATA_QCFLAG_DEFER flag or simiar), after we have cleared DID_TIME_OUT
using set_host_byte(scmd, DID_OK):
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.19-rc3/drivers/ata/libata-eh.c#L640

Since this works for CDL commands, I don't see why we shouldn't be able to
also send a non-NCQ command (if there are NCQ commands active), via SCSI
EH, so that SCSI itself retries the command, rather than us holding/hiding
a command from the SCSI queue, by using an additional workqueue in libata.

(If libata is just a SCSI LLDD, it somehow feels more logical to make use
of the SCSI queue, rather than to add our own queueing in libata using a
workqueue.)


Kind regards,
Niklas
