Yes.

With a few exceptions, the entries in the libata white/blacklist were
submitted by Crucial/Micron themselves. But it's possible that they
changed their naming scheme.

The newest drives I have are M550 models.

There's no way to exhaustively test. Many drives will return zeroes most
of the time but can have corner conditions that cause them to ignore
TRIM commands.

The ones we whitelisted were as a result of feedback from the vendors
themselves (thanks to an advertised qualification for use with hardware
RAID5 controllers). As you know, there is no way for a drive to express
this capability/guarantee in the ATA protocol.

# grep . /sys/class/ata_device/*/trim
/sys/class/ata_device/dev1.0/trim:unqueued
/sys/class/ata_device/dev2.0/trim:queued

lsblk looks at /sys/block/*/queue/discard*

You get "0" for the discard granularity on the Samsung?
